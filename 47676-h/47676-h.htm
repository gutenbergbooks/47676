    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> was preparing to
      write of arms and impetuous warfare in serious numbers, <a
      href="#linknote-003" name="linknoteref-003" id="linknoteref-003"><small>003</small></a>
      the subject-matter being suited to the measure. <a href="#linknote-004"

      second verse was of equal measure with the first; but Cupid is said to
      have smiled, and to have abstracted one foot. <a href="#linknote-005"
      name="linknoteref-005" id="linknoteref-005"><small>005</small></a> "Who,
      cruel boy, has given thee this right over my lines? We poets are the choir
      of <i>the Muses,</i> the Pierian maids, not thine. What if Venus were to
      seize the arms of the yellow-haired Minerva, <i>and</i> if the
      yellow-haired Minerva were to wave the lighted torches <i>of Love?</i> Who
      would approve of Ceres holding her reign in the woods on the mountain
      ridges, <i>or</i> of the fields being tilled under the control of the
      quivered Virgin? Who would arm Phoebus, graceful with his locks, with the
      sharp spear, while Mars is striking the Aonian lyre? Thy sway, O youth, is
      great, and far too potent; why, in thy ambition, dost thou attempt a new
      task? Is that which is everywhere, thine? Is Heliconian Tempe thine? Is
      even his own lyre hardly safe now for Phoebus? When the new page has made
      a good beginning in the first line, at that moment does he diminish my
      energies. <a href="#linknote-008" name="linknoteref-008"
      id="linknoteref-008"><small>008</small></a> I have no subject fitted for
      <i>these</i> lighter numbers, whether youth, or girl with her flowing
      locks arranged."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Thus</i> was I complaining; when, at once, his quiver loosened, <a
      href="#linknote-009" name="linknoteref-009" id="linknoteref-009"><small>009</small></a>
      he selected the arrows made for my destruction; and he stoutly bent upon
      his knee the curving bow, and said, "Poet, receive a subject on which to
      sing." Ah wretched me! unerring arrows did that youth possess. I burn; and
      in my heart, <i>hitherto</i> disengaged, does Love hold sway. <i>Henceforth</i>,
      in six feet <a href="#linknote-010" name="linknoteref-010"
      id="linknoteref-010"><small>010</small></a> let my work commence; in five

      <i>He says, that being taken captive by Love, he allows Cupid to lead him
      away in triumph.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hy shall I say it
      is, that my bed appears thus hard to me, and that my clothes rest not upon
      the couch? The night, too, long as it is, have I passed without sleep; and
      why do the weary bones of my restless body ache? But were I assailed by
      any flame, I think I should be sensible of it. Or does <i>Love</i> come
      unawares and cunningly attack in silent ambush? 'Tis so; his little arrows
      have pierced my heart; and cruel Love is tormenting the breast he has
      seized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Am I to yield? Or by struggling <i>against it</i>, am I to increase this
      sudden flame? I must yield; the burden becomes light which is borne
      contentedly. I have seen the flames increase when agitated by waving the
      torch; and when no one shook it, I have seen them die away. The galled
      bulls suffer more blows while at first they refuse the yoke, than those
      whom experience of the plough avails. The horse which is unbroken bruises
      his mouth with the hard curb; the one that is acquainted with arms is less
      sensible of the bit. Love goads more sharply and much more cruelly those
      who struggle, than those who agree to endure his servitude. Lo! I confess
      it; I am thy new-made prey, O Cupid; I am extending my conquered hands for
      thy commands. No war <i>between us</i> is needed; I entreat for peace and
      for pardon; and no credit shall I be to thee, unarmed, conquered by thy
      arms. Bind thy locks with myrtle; yoke thy mother's doves; thy stepfather
      <a href="#linknote-014" name="linknoteref-014" id="linknoteref-014"><small>014</small></a>
      himself will give a chariot which becomes thee. And in the chariot <i>so</i>
      given thee, thou shalt stand, and with thy skill shalt guide the birds <i>so</i>
      yoked <a href="#linknote-015" name="linknoteref-015" id="linknoteref-015"><small>015</small></a>,
      while the people shout "<i>Io</i> triumphe" <a href="#linknote-016"
      name="linknoteref-016" id="linknoteref-016"><small>016</small></a> aloud.
      The captured youths and the captive fair shall be led <i>in triumph</i>;
      this procession shall be a splendid triumph for thee. I myself, a recent
      capture, shall bear my wound <i>so</i> lately made; and with the feelings
      of a captive shall I endure thy recent chains. Soundness of Understanding
      shall-be led along with hands bound behind his back, Shame as well, and
      whatever <i>beside</i> is an enemy to the camp of Love. All things shall
      stand in awe of thee: towards thee the throng, stretching forth its hands,
      shall sing "Io triumphe" with loud voice. Caresses shall be thy
      attendants, Error too, and Madness, a troop that ever follows on thy side.
      With these for thy soldiers, thou dost overcome both men and Gods; take
      away from thee these advantages, <i>and</i> thou wilt be helpless. From
      highest Olympus thy joyous mother will applaud thee in thy triumph, and
      will sprinkle her roses falling on thy face. While gems bedeck thy wings,
      <i>and</i> gems thy hair; in thy golden chariot shalt thou go, resplendent
      thyself with gold. <a href="#linknote-017" name="linknoteref-017"
      id="linknoteref-017"><small>017</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then too, (if well I know thee) wilt thou influence not a few; then too,
      as thou passest by, wilt thou inflict many a wound. Thy arrows (even
      shouldst thou thyself desire it) cannot be at rest. A glowing flame <i>ever</i>
      injures by the propinquity of its heat. Just such was Bacchus when the
      Gangetic land <a href="#linknote-018" name="linknoteref-018"
      id="linknoteref-018"><small>018</small></a> was subdued; thou art the
      burden of the birds; he was <i>that</i> of the tigers. Therefore, since I
      may be some portion of thy hallowed triumph, forbear, Conqueror, to expend
      thy strength on me. Look at the prospering arms of thy kinsman Cæsar; <a
      href="#linknote-019" name="linknoteref-019" id="linknoteref-019"><small>019</small></a>
      with the same hand with which he conquers does he shield the conquered. <a

      the two-formed men to combat when the wine was placed <i>on table</i>. No

      I seem to be hardly able to withhold my hands from you. Learn, however,
      what must be done by you; and do not give my injunctions to be borne away
      by the Eastern gales, nor on the warm winds of the South.
    </p>
    <p>
      Come before your husband; and yet, I do not see what can be done, if you
      do come first; but still, do come first. <a href="#linknote-031"

      my secret signs, <a href="#linknote-033" name="linknoteref-033"

      wine. <a href="#linknote-035" name="linknoteref-035" id="linknoteref-035"><small>035</small></a>
      When the delights of our dalliance recur to your thoughts, press your
      blooming cheeks <a href="#linknote-036" name="linknoteref-036"
      id="linknoteref-036"><small>036</small></a> with your beauteous finger. If
      there shall be anything, of which you may be making complaint about me
      silently in your mind, let your delicate hand reach from the extremity of
      your ear. When, my life, I shall either do or say aught which shall give
      you delight, let your ring be continually twisted on your fingers. <a

      Take hold of the table with your hand, in the way in which those who are
      in prayer <a href="#linknote-038" name="linknoteref-038"
      id="linknoteref-038"><small>038</small></a> take hold <i>of the altar</i>,
      when you shall be wishing many an evil for your husband, who so well
      deserves it. <i>The cup</i> which he has mixed for you, if you are
      discreet, <a href="#linknote-039" name="linknoteref-039"
      id="linknoteref-039"><small>039</small></a> bid him drink himself; <i>then</i>,

      name="linknoteref-041" id="linknoteref-041"><small>041</small></a> for
      what <i>wine</i> you wish. I will at once take the cup which you have put
      down; <a href="#linknote-042" name="linknoteref-042" id="linknoteref-042"><small>042</small></a>
      and where you have sipped, on that side will I drink. If, perchance, he
      shall give you any morsels, of which he has tasted beforehand, reject them
      <i>thus</i> touched by his mouth. <a href="#linknote-043"
      name="linknoteref-043" id="linknoteref-043"><small>043</small></a> And do
      not allow him to press your neck, by putting his arms around it; nor
      recline your gentle head on his unsightly breast. <a href="#linknote-044"
      name="linknoteref-044" id="linknoteref-044"><small>044</small></a> Let not
      your bosom, or your breasts so close at hand, <a href="#linknote-045"
      name="linknoteref-045" id="linknoteref-045"><small>045</small></a> admit
      his fingers; <i>and</i> especially allow him to give you no kisses. If you
      do give him <i>any</i> kisses, I shall be discovered to be your lover, and
      I shall say, "Those are my own," and shall be laying hands upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, this I shall <i>be able to</i> see; but what the clothing carefully
      conceals, the same will be a cause for me of apprehension full of doubts.
      Touch not his thigh with yours, and cross not legs with him, and do not
      unite your delicate foot with his uncouth leg. To my misery, I am
      apprehensive of many a thing, because many a thing have I done in my
      wantonness; and I myself am tormented, through fear of my own precedent.
    </p>

      name="linknoteref-048" id="linknoteref-048"><small>048</small></a> have my
      mistress and I forestalled our hurried delights. This, I <i>am sure</i>,
      you will not do <i>for him</i>; but that you may not <i>even</i> be
      supposed to do so, take away the conscious covering <a href="#linknote-049"
      name="linknoteref-049" id="linknoteref-049"><small>049</small></a> from
      your bosom. Bid your husband drink incessantly, but let there be no kisses
      with your entreaties; and while he is drinking, if you can, add wine by
      stealth. <a href="#linknote-050" name="linknoteref-050"
      id="linknoteref-050"><small>050</small></a> If he shall be soundly laid
      asleep with dozing and wine, circumstances and opportunity will give us <i>fitting</i>
      counsel. When you shall rise to go home, we all will rise as well; <i>and</i>
      remember that you walk in the middle rank of the throng. In that rank you
      will either find me, or be found <i>by me</i>; <i>and</i> whatever part of
      me you can there touch, <i>mind and</i> touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah wretched me! I have given advice to be good for <i>but</i> a few hours;
      <i>then</i>, at the bidding of night, I am separated from my mistress. At
      night her husband will lock her in; I, sad with my gushing tears, will
      follow her as far as I may, even to her obdurate door. <i>And</i> now will
      he be snatching a kiss; <i>and</i> now not kisses only will he snatch; you
      will be compelled to grant him that, which by stealth you grant to me. But
      grant him this (you can do so) with a bad grace, and like one acting by
      compulsion; let no caresses be heard; and let Venus prove inauspicious. If
      my wishes avail, I trust, too, that he will find no satisfaction therein;
      but if otherwise, still at least let it have no delights for you. But,
      however, whatever luck may attend upon the night, assure me in positive
      language to-morrow, that you did not dally with him.

      be refreshed on the middle of the couch. A part of the window <a

      was thrown open, the other part shut; the light was such as the woods are

      but a small impediment; still, to be covered with the tunic did she
      strive; and, as she struggled as though she was not desirous to conquer,
      without difficulty was she overcome, through betrayal of herself. When,
      her clothing laid aside, she stood before my eyes, throughout her whole
      body nowhere was there a blemish. What shoulders, what arms I <i>both</i>
      saw and touched! The contour of her breast, how formed was it to be
      pressed! How smooth her stomach beneath her faultless bosom! How full and
      how beauteous her sides! How plump with youthfulness the thigh! <i>But</i>
      why enlarge on every point? Nothing did I behold not worthy of praise; and
      I pressed her person even to my own.

      passage. Protracted Love has made my body thin for such an emergency, and
      by diminishing my bulk, has rendered my limbs <i>quite</i> supple.'Tis he
      who shows me how to go softly amid the watches of the keepers; <a

      afraid of the night and imaginary ghosts; <i>and</i> I used to be
      surprised if any one was about to go in the dark: Cupid, with his graceful
      mother, laughed, so that I could hear him, and he softly said, "Thou too

      I only fear you, <i>thus</i> too tardy; you alone do I court; you hold the
      lightning by which you can effect my destruction. Look (and that you may
      see, loosen the obdurate bars) how the door has been made wet with my

      supported by its hard oaken <i>posts</i>, is still unmoved. Let the
      protection of a closed gate be of value to cities when besieged; <i>but</i>
      why, in the midst of peace are you dreading warfare? What would you do to
      an enemy, who thus shut out the lover? The hours of the night pass on;
      from the door-post strike away the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not come attended with soldiers and with arms; I should be alone, if
      ruthless Love were not here. Him, even if I should desire it, I can never
      send away; first should I be even severed from my limbs. Love then, and a
      little wine about my temples, <a href="#linknote-069"
      name="linknoteref-069" id="linknoteref-069"><small>069</small></a> are

      dread arms <i>such</i> as these? Who may not go out to face them? The
      hours of the night pass on; from the door-post strike away the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you delaying? or does sleep (who but ill befriends the lover) give to
      the winds my words, as they are repelled from your ear? But, I remember,
      when formerly I used to avoid you, you were awake, with the stars of the
      midnight. Perhaps, too, your own mistress is now asleep with you; alas!
      how much superior <i>then</i> is your fate to my own! And since 'tis so,
      pass on to me, ye cruel chains. The hours of the night pass on; from the
      door-post strike away the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Am I mistaken? Or did the door-posts creak with the turning hinge, and did
      the shaken door give the jarring signal? Yes, I am mistaken; the door was
      shaken by the boisterous wind. Ah me! how far away has that gust borne my
      hopes! Boreas, if well thou dost keep in mind the ravished Orithyia, come
      hither, and with thy blast beat open this relentless door. 'Tis silence
      throughout all the City; damp with the glassy dew, the hours of the night

      Love <i>are without fear</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have expended every method; neither by entreaties nor by threats have I
      moved you, O <i>man, even</i> more deaf yourself than your door. It
      becomes you not to watch the threshold of the beauteous fair; of the
      anxieties of the prison, <a href="#linknote-076" name="linknoteref-076"

      joyous no longer, be you the livelong night upon this obdurate threshold.
      You, when in the morning she shall see you <i>thus</i> exposed, will be a
      witness of my time thus thrown away. <i>Porter</i>, whatever your
      disposition, good bye, and <i>one day</i> experience the pangs of him who

      Who did not say to me, "You madman!" who did not say <i>to me</i>, "You
      barbarian!" She herself <i>said</i> not a word; her tongue was restrained
      by timid apprehensions. But still her silent features pronounced my
      censure; by her tears <i>and</i> by her silent lips did she convict me.
    </p>
    <p>
      First could I wish that my arms had fallen from off my shoulders; to
      better purpose could I have parted with a portion of myself. To my own
      disadvantage had I the strength of a madman; and for my own punishment did
      I stoutly exert my strength. What do I want with you, ye ministers of
      death and criminality? Impious hands, submit to the chains, your due.
      Should I not have been punished had I struck the humblest Roman <a
      href="#linknote-085" name="linknoteref-085" id="linknoteref-085"><small>085</small></a>
      of the multitude? <i>And</i> shall I have a greater privilege against my
      mistress? The son of Tydeus has left the worst instance of crime: he was
      the first to strike a Goddess, <a href="#linknote-086"
      name="linknoteref-086" id="linknoteref-086"><small>086</small></a> I, the
      second. But less guilty was he; by me, she, whom I asserted to be loved <i>by
      me</i>, was injured; against an enemy the son of Tydeus was infuriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Come now, conqueror, prepare your boastful triumphs; bind your locks with
      laurel, and pay your vows to Jove, and let the multitude, the train, that
      escorts your chariot, shout aloud, "Io <i>triumphe!</i> by <i>this</i>
      valiant man has the fair been conquered!" Let the captive, in her sadness,
      go before with dishevelled locks, pale all over, if her hurt cheeks <a
      href="#linknote-087" name="linknoteref-087" id="linknoteref-087"><small>087</small></a>
      may allow.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, if, after the manner of a swelling torrent, I was impelled, and
      if impetuous anger did make me its prey; would it not have been enough to
      have shouted aloud at the trembling girl, and not to have thundered out my
      threats far too severe? Or else, to my own disgrace, to have torn her
      tunic from its upper edge down to the middle? Her girdle should, at the
      middle <a href="#linknote-089" name="linknoteref-089" id="linknoteref-089"><small>089</small></a>
      have come to its aid. But now, in the hardness of my heart, I could dare,
      seizing her hair on her forehead, to mark her free-born cheeks <a
      href="#linknote-090" name="linknoteref-090" id="linknoteref-090"><small>090</small></a>
      with my nails. <i>There</i> she stood, amazed, with her features pale and
      bloodless, just as the marble is cut in the Parian mountains. <a
      href="#linknote-091" name="linknoteref-091" id="linknoteref-091"><small>091</small></a>
      I saw her fainting limbs, and her palpitating members; just as when the
      breeze waves the foliage of the poplars; just as the slender reed quivers
      with the gentle Zephyr; or, as when the surface of the waves is skimmed by
      the warm South wind. Her tears, too, so long repressed, flowed down her
      face, just as the water flows from the snow when heaped up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, for the first time, did I begin to be sensible that I was guilty;
      the tears which she was shedding were <i>as</i> my own blood. Yet, thrice
      was I ready, suppliantly to throw myself before her feet; thrice did she
      repel my dreaded hands. But, <i>dearest,</i> do not you hesitate, (<i>for</i>
      revenge will lessen your grief) at once to attack my face with your nails.
      Spare not my eyes, nor <i>yet</i> my hair; let anger nerve your hands,
      weak though they may be.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that tokens so shocking of my criminality may no longer exist, put
      your locks, arranged anew, in their proper order. <a href="#linknote-092"

      I have beheld (if I may be believed) the stars dripping with blood: the

      name="linknoteref-101" id="linknoteref-101"><small>101</small></a> was
      flying amid the shades of night, and that her hag's carcase was covered
      with feathers. <i>This</i> I believe, and such is the report. A double
      pupil, too, <a href="#linknote-102" name="linknoteref-102"
      id="linknoteref-102"><small>102</small></a> sparkles in her eyes, and

      as well; and with her long incantations she cleaves the solid ground. She
      has made it her occupation to violate the chaste bed; and besides, her

      <a href="#linknote-105" name="linknoteref-105" id="linknoteref-105"><small>105</small></a>
      concealed me.

    <p>
      "You understand, my life, how greatly you yesterday pleased a wealthy
      young man; <i>for</i> he stopped short, and stood gazing for some time on
      your face. And whom do you not please? Your beauty is inferior to no
      one's. <i>But</i> woe is me! your person has not a fitting dress. I <i>only</i>
      wish you were as well off, as you are distinguished for beauty; if you
      became rich, I should not be poor. The adverse star of Mars in opposition
      <a href="#linknote-106" name="linknoteref-106" id="linknoteref-106"><small>106</small></a>
      was unfortunate for you; Mars has gone; now Venus is befriending you with
      her planet. See now how favourable she is on her approach; a rich lover is
      sighing for you, and he makes it his care <a href="#linknote-107"
      name="linknoteref-107" id="linknoteref-107"><small>107</small></a> what
      are your requirements. He has good looks, too, that may compare with your

      name="linknoteref-108" id="linknoteref-108"><small>108</small></a>
      "Blushing," <i>said the hag</i>, "suits a faircomplexion indeed; but if
      you <i>only</i> pretend it, 'tis an advantage; <i>if</i> real, it is wont
      to be injurious. When, your eyes cast down, <a href="#linknote-109"

      when Tati us was king, were unwilling to be accommodating to more men <i>than

      warfare; <a href="#linknote-112" name="linknoteref-112"
      id="linknoteref-112"><small>112</small></a> but Venus holds sway in the
      City of her own Æneas. Enjoy yourselves, my pretty ones; she is chaste,
      whom nobody has courted; or else, if coyness does not prevent her, she
      herself is the wooer. Dispel these frowns <a href="#linknote-113"
      name="linknoteref-113" id="linknoteref-113"><small>113</small></a> as
      well, which you are carrying upon your lofty brow; with those frowns will
      numerous failings be removed. Penelope used to try <a href="#linknote-114"
      name="linknoteref-114" id="linknoteref-114"><small>114</small></a> the
      strength of the young men upon the bow; the bow that tested <i>the
      strength</i> of their sides, was made of horn. Age glides stealthily on,
      and beguiles us as it flies; just as the swift river glides onward with
      its flowing waters. Brass grows bright by use; good clothes require to be
      worn; uninhabited buildings grow white with nasty mould. Unless you
      entertain <i>lovers</i>, beauty <i>soon</i> waxes old, with no one to
      enjoy it; and <i>even</i> one or two <i>lovers</i> are not sufficiently
      profitable. From many <i>of them</i>, gain is more sure, and not so
      difficult to be got. An abundant prey falls to the hoary wolves out of a
      <i>whole</i> flock.

      "See now! what does this poet of yours make you a present of besides his

      href="#linknote-116" name="linknoteref-116" id="linknoteref-116"><small>116</small></a>
      adorned with gold, strikes the harmonious strings of the gilded lyre. He
      that shall make you presents, let him be to you greater than great Homer;
      believe me, it is a noble thing to give. And, if there shall be any one
      redeemed at a price for his person <a href="#linknote-117"
      name="linknoteref-117" id="linknoteref-117"><small>117</small></a>, do not

      href="#linknote-118" name="linknoteref-118" id="linknoteref-118"><small>118</small></a>
      is a mere trifle. Neither let the old-fashioned wax busts about the halls
      <a href="#linknote-119" name="linknoteref-119" id="linknoteref-119"><small>119</small></a>
      take you in; pack off with your forefathers, you needy lover. Nay more,
      should <a href="#linknote-120" name="linknoteref-120" id="linknoteref-120"><small>120</small></a>
      one, because he is good-looking, ask for a night without a present; <i>why</i>,
      let him first solicit his own admirer for something to present to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be less exacting of presents, while you are laying your nets, <i>for fear</i>
      lest they should escape you: <i>once</i> caught, tease them at your own
      pleasure. Pretended affection, too, is not a bad thing; let him fancy he
      is loved; but have you a care that this affection is not all for nothing.
      Often refuse your favours; sometimes pretend a head-ache; and sometimes
      there will be Isis <a href="#linknote-121" name="linknoteref-121"
      id="linknoteref-121"><small>121</small></a> to afford a pretext. <i>But</i>
      soon admit him again; that he may acquire no habits of endurance, and that
      his love, so often repulsed, may not begin to flag. Let your door be deaf
      to him who entreats, open to him who brings. Let the lover that is
      admitted, hear the remarks of him who is excluded. And, as though you were
      the first injured, sometimes get in a passion with him when injured <i>by
      you</i>. His censure, when counterbalanced by your censure, <a
      href="#linknote-127" name="linknoteref-127" id="linknoteref-127"><small>127</small></a>
      may wear away. But do you never afford a long duration for anger;
      prolonged anger frequently produces hatred. Moreover, let your eyes learn,
      at discretion, to shed tears; and let this cause or that cause your cheeks
      to be wet. And do not, if you deceive any one, hesitate to be guilty of
      perjury; Venus lends <i>but</i> a deaf hearing <a href="#linknote-128"
      name="linknoteref-128" id="linknoteref-128"><small>128</small></a> to
      deceived <i>lovers</i>.

      "Let a male servant and a crafty handmaid <a href="#linknote-129"
      name="linknoteref-129" id="linknoteref-129"><small>129</small></a> be
      trained up to their parts; who may instruct him what may be conveniently
      purchased for you. And let them ask but little for themselves; if they ask
      a little of many, <a href="#linknote-130" name="linknoteref-130"

      mother, and your nurse as well, fleece your admirer. A booty is soon made,
      that is sought by many hands. When occasions for asking for presents shall
      fail you, call attention with a cake <a href="#linknote-132"
      name="linknoteref-132" id="linknoteref-132"><small>132</small></a> to your
      birthday Take care that no one loves you in security, without a rival;
      love is not very lasting if you remove <i>all</i> rivalry. Let him
      perceive the traces of <i>another</i> person on the couch; all your neck,
      too, discoloured by the marks of toying. Especially let him see the
      presents, which another has sent. If he gives you nothing, the Sacred
      Street <a href="#linknote-133" name="linknoteref-133" id="linknoteref-133"><small>133</small></a>
      must be talked about. When you have received many things, but yet he has
      not given you every thing, be continually asking him to lend you
      something, for you never to return. Let your tongue aid you, and let it
      conceal your thoughts; <a href="#linknote-134" name="linknoteref-134"
      id="linknoteref-134"><small>134</small></a> caress him, and prove his
      ruin. <a href="#linknote-135" name="linknoteref-135" id="linknoteref-135"><small>135</small></a>
      Beneath the luscious honey cursed poisons lie concealed. If you observe
      these precepts, tried by me throughout a long experience; and if the winds
      and the breezes do not bear away my words; often will you bless me while I
      live; often will you pray, when I am dead, that in quietude my bones may
      repose.".

      She was in the middle of her speech, when my shadow betrayed me; but my

    </p>

      href="#linknote-138" name="linknoteref-138" id="linknoteref-138"><small>138</small></a>
      every lover is a soldier. The age which is fitted for war, is suited to
      love as well. For an old man to be a soldier, is shocking; amorousness in
      an old man is shocking. The years which <a href="#linknote-139"
      name="linknoteref-139" id="linknoteref-139"><small>139</small></a>
      generals require in the valiant soldier, the same does the charming fair
      require in her husband. Both <i>soldier and lover</i> pass sleepless
      nights; both rest upon the ground. The one watches at the door of his
      mistress; but the other <i>at that</i> of his general. <a
      href="#linknote-140" name="linknoteref-140" id="linknoteref-140"><small>140</small></a>
      Long marches are the duty of the soldier; send the fair <i>far</i> away,
      <i>and</i> the lover will boldly follow her, without a limit <i>to his
      endurance</i>. Over opposing mountains will he go, and rivers swollen with
      rains; the accumulating snows will he pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      About to plough the waves, he will not reproach the stormy East winds; nor
      will he watch for Constellations favourable for scudding over the waves.
      Who, except either the soldier or the lover, will submit to both the chill
      of the night, and the snows mingled with the heavy showers? The one is
      sent as a spy against the hostile foe; the other keeps his eye on his
      rival, as though upon an enemy. The one lays siege to stubborn cities, the
      other to the threshold of his obdurate mistress: the one bursts open
      gates, and the other, doors. <a href="#linknote-142" name="linknoteref-142"
      id="linknoteref-142"><small>142</small></a> Full oft has it answered to
      attack the enemy when buried in sleep; and to slaughter an unarmed
      multitude with armed hand. Thus did the fierce troops of the Thracian
      Rhesus <a href="#linknote-143" name="linknoteref-143" id="linknoteref-143"><small>143</small></a>
      fall; and you, captured steeds, forsook your lord. Full oft do lovers take
      advantage of the sleep of husbands, and brandish their arms against the
      slumbering foe. To escape the troops of the sentinels, and the bands of
      the patrol, is the part <i>both</i> of the soldier, and of the lover
      always in misery. Mars is wayward, and Venus is uncertain; both the
      conquered rise again, and those fall whom you would say could never
      possibly be prostrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whoever, then, has pronounced Love <i>mere</i> slothfulness, let him cease
      <i>to love</i>: <a href="#linknote-144" name="linknoteref-144"
      id="linknoteref-144"><small>144</small></a> to the discerning mind does
      Love belong. The mighty Achilles is inflamed by the captive Briseis.
      Trojans, while you may, destroy the Argive resources. Hector used to go to
      battle <i>fresh</i> from the embraces of Andromache; and it was his wife
      who placed his helmet on his head. The son of Atreus, the first of <i>all</i>
      the chiefs, on beholding the daughter of Priam, is said to have been
      smitten with the dishevelled locks of the raving <i>prophetess</i>. <a
      href="#linknote-146" name="linknoteref-146" id="linknoteref-146"><small>146</small></a>
      Mars, too, when caught, was sensible of the chains wrought at the forge;
      <a href="#linknote-147" name="linknoteref-147" id="linknoteref-147"><small>147</small></a>
      there was no story better known than his, in all the heavens.

      the couch and the shade <a href="#linknote-149" name="linknoteref-149"
      id="linknoteref-149"><small>149</small></a> had enervated my mind.
      Attentions to the charming fair gave a fillip to me, in my indolence; and
      <i>Love</i> commanded me to serve <a href="#linknote-150"
      name="linknoteref-150" id="linknoteref-150"><small>150</small></a> in his
      camp. Hence it is that thou seest me active, and waging the warfare by
      night. Let him who wishes not to become slothful, fall in love.

      cause of warfare to her two husbands; such as Leda was, whom her crafty
      paramour, concealed in his white feathers, deceived under <i>the form of</i>
      a fictitious bird; such as Amymone <a href="#linknote-152"
      name="linknoteref-152" id="linknoteref-152"><small>152</small></a> used to
      wander in the parched <i>fields of</i> Argos, when the urn was pressing
      the locks on the top of her head; such were you; and I was in dread of
      both the eagle and the bull with respect to you, and whatever <i>form
      besides</i> Love has created of the mighty Jove.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, all fears are gone, and the disease of my mind is cured; and now no
      longer does that form <i>of yours</i> rivet my eyes. Do you inquire why I
      am changed? <i>It is</i>, because you require presents. This reason does
      not allow of your pleasing me. So long as you were disinterested, I was in
      love with your mind together with your person; now, <i>in my estimation</i>
      your appearance is affected by this blemish on your disposition. Love is
      both a child and naked; he has years without sordidness, and <i>he wears</i>
      no clothes, that he may be without concealment. Why do you require the son
      of Venus to be prostituted at a price? He has no fold in his dress, <a
      href="#linknote-153" name="linknoteref-153" id="linknoteref-153"><small>153</small></a>
      in which to conceal that price. Neither Venus is suited for cruel arms,
      nor yet the son of Venus; it befits not such unwarlike Divinities to serve
      for pay. The courtesan stands for hire to any one at a certain price; and
      with her submissive body, she seeks for wretched pelf. Still, she curses
      the tyranny of the avaricious procurer; <a href="#linknote-154"
      name="linknoteref-154" id="linknoteref-154"><small>154</small></a> and she
      does by compulsion <a href="#linknote-155" name="linknoteref-155"
      id="linknoteref-155"><small>155</small></a> what you are doing of your own
      free will.

      Take, as an example, the cattle, devoid of reason; it were a shocking
      thing for there to be a finer feeling in the brutes. The mare asks no gift
      of the horse, nor the cow of the bull; the ram does not woo the ewe,
      induced by presents. Woman alone takes pleasure in spoils torn from the
      man; she alone lets out her nights; alone is she on sale, to be hired at a
      price. She sells, too, <i>joys</i> that delight them both, <i>and</i>
      which both covet; and she makes it a <i>matter</i> of pay, at what price
      she herself is to be gratified. Those joys, which are so equally sweet to
      both, why does the one sell, and <i>why</i> the other buy them? Why must
      that delight prove a loss to me, to you a gain, for which the female and
      the male combine with kindred impulse? Witnesses hired dishonestly, <a
      href="#linknote-156" name="linknoteref-156" id="linknoteref-156"><small>156</small></a>
      sell their perjuries; the chest <a href="#linknote-157"

      commissioned judge <a href="#linknote-158" name="linknoteref-158"
      id="linknoteref-158"><small>158</small></a> is disgracefully open <i>for
      the bribe</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tis a dishonourable thing to defend the wretched criminals with a tongue
      that is purchased; <a href="#linknote-159" name="linknoteref-159"
      id="linknoteref-159"><small>159</small></a> 'tis a disgrace for a tribunal
      to make great acquisitions. 'Tis a disgrace for a woman to increase her
      patrimonial possessions by the profits of her embraces, and to prostitute
      her beauty for lucre. Thanks are <i>justly</i> due for things obtained
      without purchase; there are no thanks for an intercourse disgracefully
      bartered. He who hires, <a href="#linknote-160" name="linknoteref-160"
      id="linknoteref-160"><small>160</small></a> pays all <i>his due</i>; the
      price <i>once</i> paid, he no longer remains a debtor for your
      acquiescence. Cease, ye beauties, to bargain for pay for your favours.
      Sordid gains bring no good results. It was not worth her while to bargain
      for the Sabine bracelets, <a href="#linknote-161" name="linknoteref-161"
      id="linknoteref-161"><small>161</small></a> in order that the arms should
      crush the head of the sacred maiden. The son pierced <a
      href="#linknote-163" name="linknoteref-163" id="linknoteref-163"><small>163</small></a>
      with the sword those entrails from which he had sprung, and a simple
      necklace <a href="#linknote-164" name="linknoteref-164"
      id="linknoteref-164"><small>164</small></a> was the cause of the
      punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But yet it is not unbecoming for a present to be asked of the wealthy man;
      he has something to give to her who does ask for a present. Pluck the
      grapes that hang from the loaded vines; let the fruitful soil of Alcinous
      <a href="#linknote-165" name="linknoteref-165" id="linknoteref-165"><small>165</small></a>
      afford the apples. Let the needy man proffer duty, zeal, and fidelity;
      what each one possesses, let him bestow it all upon his mistress. My
      endowments, too, are in my lines to shig the praises of those fair who
      deserve them; she, whom I choose, becomes celebrated through my skill.
      Vestments will rend, gems and gold will spoil; the fame which poesy
      confers is everlasting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Still</i> I do not detest giving and revolt at it, but at being asked
      for a price. Cease to demand it, <i>and</i> I will give you that which I
      refuse you while you ask.

      now you have no hair <i>left</i>, that you can be dyeing. But, if you had

      Or <i>like</i> the thread which the spider draws out with her slender
      legs, when she fastens her light work beneath the neglected beam? And yet
      its colour was not black, nor yet was it golden, but though it was
      neither, it was a mixture of them both. A <i>colour</i>, such as the tall
      cedar has in the moist vallies of craggy Ida, when its bark is stript off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, it was <i>quite</i> tractable, and falling into a thousand
      ringlets; and it was the cause of no trouble to you. Neither the bodkin,
      <a href="#linknote-208" name="linknoteref-208" id="linknoteref-208"><small>208</small></a>
      nor the tooth of the comb <i>ever</i> tore it; your tire woman always had

      arms. Many a time too, in the morning, her locks not yet arranged, was she
      lying on the purple couch, with her face half upturned. Then even,
      unadorned, was she beauteous; as when the Thracian Bacchanal, in her
      weariness, throws herself carelessly upon the green grass. Still, fine as
      it was, and just like down, what evils, alas! did her tortured hair
      endure! How patiently did it submit itself to the iron and the fire; <a
      href="#linknote-211" name="linknoteref-211" id="linknoteref-211"><small>211</small></a>
      that the curls might become crisp with their twisting circlets. "'Tis a
      shame," I used to cry, "'tis a shame, to be burning that hair; naturally
      it is becoming; do, cruel one, be merciful to your own head. Away with all
      violence from it; it is not <i>hair</i> that deserves to be scorched; the

    </p>
    <p>
      Those beauteous locks are gone; which Apollo might have longed for, <i>and</i>
      which Bacchus might have wished to be on his own head. With them I might
      compare those, which naked Dione is painted <a href="#linknote-213"
      name="linknoteref-213" id="linknoteref-213"><small>213</small></a> as once

      with disconsolate hand? You are not seen to advantage by yourself with

      done you this injury; no treacherous hag has been washing you with

      for you her captured locks; by the favour of a conquered race you will be
      adorned. Ah! how many a time will you have to blush, as any one admires
      your hair; and <i>then</i> you will say, "Now I am receiving praise for a
      bought commodity! In place of myself, he is now bepraising some Sygambrian
      girl <a href="#linknote-218" name="linknoteref-218" id="linknoteref-218"><small>218</small></a>

    <p>
      Wretch that I am! with difficulty does she restrain her tears; and she
      covers her face with her hand, having her delicate cheeks suffused with
      blushes. She is venturing to look at her former locks, <i>placed</i> in
      her bosom; a treasure, alas! not fitted for that spot. <a

      dost thou blame me for years of slothfulness; and <i>why</i> dost thou
      call poesy the employment of an idle mind? <i>Thou sayest</i> that I do
      not, after the manner of my ancestors, while vigorous years allow me, seek
      the prizes of warfare covered with dust; that I do not make myself

      will to all time be sung throughout the whole world; although he is not
      powerful in genius, in his skill he shows his might. No mischance will <i>ever</i>
      come to the <i>tragic</i> buskin <a href="#linknote-227"

      have a name that will perish with no lapse of time.

      Lucretius, <a href="#linknote-233" name="linknoteref-233"

      <a href="#linknote-235" name="linknoteref-235" id="linknoteref-235"><small>235</small></a>
      shalt be the ruler of the conquered earth. So long as the flames and the

      name="linknoteref-238" id="linknoteref-238"><small>238</small></a> and
      with Gallus will his Lycoris be known. Though flint-stones, then, <i>and</i>
      though the share of the enduring plough perish by lapse of time, <i>yet</i>
      poetry is exempt from death. Let monarchs and the triumphs of monarchs
      yield to poesy, and let the wealthy shores of the golden Tagus <a
      href="#linknote-239" name="linknoteref-239" id="linknoteref-239"><small>239</small></a>
      yield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the vulgar throng admire worthless things; let the yellow-haired
      Apollo supply for me cups filled from the Castalian stream; let me bear,
      too, on my locks the myrtle that dreads the cold; and let me often be read
      by the anxious lover. Envy feeds upon the living; after death it is at
      rest, when his own reward protects each according to his merit. Still
      then, when the closing fire <a href="#linknote-240" name="linknoteref-240"
      id="linknoteref-240"><small>240</small></a> shall have consumed me, shall
      I live on; and a great portion of myself will <i>ever</i> be surviving.

      Afar hence, be afar hence, ye prudish matrons; you are not a fitting

      hands, and wielding the lightnings with Jove, which with success he was to
      hurl in behalf of his realms of the heavens, my mistress shut her door
      against me; the lightnings together with Jove did I forsake. Jupiter
      himself disappeared from my thoughts. Pardon me, O Jove; no aid did thy
      weapons afford me; the shut door was a more potent thunderbolt than thine.
      I forthwith resumed the language of endearment and trifling Elegies, those

      <i>He has seen a lady walking in the portico of the temple of Apollo, and
      has sent to know if he may wait upon her. She has replied that it is quite
      impossible, as the eunuch Bagous is set to watch her. Ovid here addresses
      Bagous, and endeavours to persuade him to relax his watch over the fair;
      and shows him how he can do so with safety.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>agous, <a
      href="#linknote-305" name="linknoteref-305" id="linknoteref-305"><small>305</small></a>
      with whom is the duty of watching over your mistress, give me your
      attention, while I say a few but suitable words to you. Yesterday morning
      I saw a young lady walking in that portico which contains the choir <i>of
      the daughters</i> of Danaus. <a href="#linknote-306" name="linknoteref-306"
      id="linknoteref-306"><small>306</small></a> At once, as she pleased me, I
      sent <i>to her</i>, and in my letter I proffered my request; with
      trembling hand, she answered me, "I cannot." And to my inquiry, why she
      could not, the cause was announced; <i>namely</i>, that your surveillance
      over your mistress is too strict.
    </p>
    <p>
      O keeper, if you are wise (believe me <i>now</i>), cease to deserve my
      hatred; every one wishes him gone, of whom he stands in dread. Her
      husband, too, is not in his senses; for who would toil at taking care of
      that of which no part is lost, even if you do not watch it? But <i>still</i>,
      in his madness, let him indulge his passion; and let him believe that the
      object is chaste which pleases universally. By your favour, liberty may by
      stealth be given to her; that <i>one day</i> she may return to you what
      you have given her. Are you ready to be a confidant; the mistress is
      obedient to the slave. You fear to be an accomplice; you may shut your
      eyes. Does she read a letter by herself; suppose her mother to have sent
      it. Does a stranger come; bye and bye let him go, <a href="#linknote-307"
      name="linknoteref-307" id="linknoteref-307"><small>307</small></a> <i>as
      though</i> an <i>old</i> acquaintance. Should she go to visit a sick
      female friend, who is not sick; in your opinion, let her be unwell. If she
      shall be a long time at the sacrifice, <a href="#linknote-308"
      name="linknoteref-308" id="linknoteref-308"><small>308</small></a> let not
      the long waiting tire you; putting your head on your breast, you can snore
      away. And don't be enquiring what can be going on at <i>the temple of</i>
      the linen-clad Isis; <a href="#linknote-309" name="linknoteref-309"
      id="linknoteref-309"><small>309</small></a> nor do you stand in any fear
      <i>whatever</i> of the curving theatres.
    </p>
    <p>
      An accomplice in the escapade will receive everlasting honour; and what is
      less trouble than <i>merely</i> to hold your tongue? He is in favour; he
      turns the house <a href="#linknote-310" name="linknoteref-310"
      id="linknoteref-310"><small>310</small></a> upside down <i>at his pleasure</i>,
      and he feels no stripes; he is omnipotent; the rest, a scrubby lot, are
      grovelling on. By him, that the real circumstances may be concealed, false
      ones are coined; and both the masters approve <a href="#linknote-311"
      name="linknoteref-311" id="linknoteref-311"><small>311</small></a> of,
      what one, <i>and that the mistress</i>, Approves of. When the husband has
      quite contracted his brow, and has pursed up his wrinkles, the caressing
      fair makes him become just as she pleases. But still, let her sometimes
      contrive some fault against you even, and let her pretend tears, and call
      you an executioner. <a href="#linknote-312" name="linknoteref-312"
      id="linknoteref-312"><small>312</small></a> Do you, on the other hand,
      making some charge which she may easily explain; by a feigned accusation
      remove all suspicion of the truth. <a href="#linknote-313"
      name="linknoteref-313" id="linknoteref-313"><small>313</small></a> In such
      case, may your honours, then may your limited savings <a
      href="#linknote-314" name="linknoteref-314" id="linknoteref-314"><small>314</small></a>
      increase; <i>only</i> do this, and in a short time you shall be a free
      man.

      You behold the chains bound around the necks of informers; <a
      href="#linknote-315" name="linknoteref-315" id="linknoteref-315"><small>315</small></a>
      the loathsome gaol receives the hearts that are unworthy of belief. In the
      midst of water Tantalus is in want of water, and catches at the apples as
      they escape him; 'twas his blabbing tongue caused this. <a
      href="#linknote-325" name="linknoteref-325" id="linknoteref-325"><small>325</small></a>
      While the keeper appointed by Juno, <a href="#linknote-326"
      name="linknoteref-326" id="linknoteref-326"><small>326</small></a> is
      watching Io too carefully, he dies before his time; she becomes a Goddess.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have seen him wearing fetters on his bruised legs, through whom a
      husband was obliged to know of an intrigue. The punishment was less than
      his deserts; an unruly tongue was the injury of the two; the husband was
      grieved; the female suffered the loss of her character. Believe me;
      accusations are pleasing to no husband, and no one do they delight, even
      though he should listen to them. If he is indifferent, then you are
      wasting your information upon ears that care nothing for it; if he dotes
      <i>on her</i>, by your officiousness is he made wretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, a faux pas, although discovered, is not so easily proved; she
      comes <i>before him</i>, protected by the prejudices of her judge. Should
      even he himself see it, still he himself will believe her as she denies
      it; and he will condemn his own eyesight, and will impose upon himself.
      Let him <i>but</i> see the tears of his spouse, and he himself will weep,
      and he will say, "That blabbing fellow shall be punished." How unequal the
      contest in which you embark! if conquered, stripes are ready for you; <i>while</i>
      she is reposing in the bosom of the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      No crime do we meditate; we meet not for mixing poisons; my hand is not
      glittering with the drawn sword. We ask that through you we may be enabled

      hundred causes for me always to be in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there any fair one that casts down her modest eyes? I am on fire; and
      that very modesty becomes an ambush against me. Is another one forward; <i>then</i>
      I am enchanted, because she is not coy; and her liveliness raises all my
      expectations. If another seems to be prudish, and to imitate the repulsive
      Sabine dames; <a href="#linknote-332" name="linknoteref-332"
      id="linknoteref-332"><small>332</small></a> I think that she is kindly
      disposed, but that she conceals it in her stateliness. <a
      href="#linknote-333" name="linknoteref-333" id="linknoteref-333"><small>333</small></a>
      Or if you are a learned fair, you please me, <i>thus</i> endowed with rare
      acquirements; or if ignorant, you are charming for your simplicity. Is
      there one who says that the lines of Callimachus are uncouth in comparison
      with mine; at once she, to whom I am <i>so</i> pleasing, pleases me. Is
      there even one who abuses both myself, the Poet, and my lines; I could
      wish to have her who so abuses me, upon my knee. Does this one walk
      leisurely, she enchants me with her gait; is another uncouth, still, she
      may become more gentle, on being more intimate with the other sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because this one sings <i>so</i> sweetly, and modulates her voice <a
      href="#linknote-334" name="linknoteref-334" id="linknoteref-334"><small>334</small></a>
      with such extreme case, I could wish to steal a kiss from her as she
      sings. Another is running through the complaining strings with active
      finger; who could not fall in love with hands so skilled? <i>And now</i>,
      one pleases by her gestures, and moves her arms to time, <a
      href="#linknote-335" name="linknoteref-335" id="linknoteref-335"><small>335</small></a>
      and moves her graceful sides with languishing art <i>in the dance</i>; to
      say nothing about myself, who am excited on every occasion, put Hippolytus
      <a href="#linknote-336" name="linknoteref-336" id="linknoteref-336"><small>336</small></a>
      there; he would become a Priapus. You, because you are so tall, equal the
      Heroines of old; <a href="#linknote-337" name="linknoteref-337"
      id="linknoteref-337"><small>337</small></a> and, of large size, you can
      fill the entire couch as you lie. Another is active from her shortness; by
      both I am enchanted; both tall and short suit my taste. Is one unadorned;
      it occurs what addition there might be if she was adorned. Is one decked
      out; she sets out her endowments to advantage. The blonde will charm me;
      the brunette <a href="#linknote-338" name="linknoteref-338"
      id="linknoteref-338"><small>338</small></a> will charm me <i>too</i>; a
      Venus is pleasing, even of a swarthy colour. Does black hair fall upon a
      neck of snow; Leda was sightly, with her raven locks. Is the hair flaxen;
      with her saffron locks, Aurora was charming. To every traditional story
      does my passion adapt itself. A youthful age charms me; <i>an age</i> more
      mature captivates me; the former is superior in the charms of person, the
      latter excels in spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fine, whatever the fair any person approves of in all the City, to all
      these does my passion aspire.

      be my extreme wish to die. It is my wish to die, as oft as I call to mind
      your guilt. Fair one, born, alas! to be a never-ceasing cause of trouble!
      It is no tablets rubbed out <a href="#linknote-339" name="linknoteref-339"

      To my sorrow, in my sober moments, with the wine on table, <a
      href="#linknote-342" name="linknoteref-342" id="linknoteref-342"><small>342</small></a>
      I myself was witness of your criminality, when you thought I was asleep. I
      saw you <i>both</i> uttering many an expression by moving your eyebrows;
      <a href="#linknote-343" name="linknoteref-343" id="linknoteref-343"><small>343</small></a>
      in your nods there was a considerable amount of language. Your eyes were
      not silent, <a href="#linknote-344" name="linknoteref-344"
      id="linknoteref-344"><small>344</small></a> the table, too, traced over
      with wine; <a href="#linknote-345" name="linknoteref-345"
      id="linknoteref-345"><small>345</small></a> nor was the language of the
      fingers wanting; I understood your discourse, <a href="#linknote-346"
      name="linknoteref-346" id="linknoteref-346"><small>346</small></a> which
      treated of that which it did not appear to do; the words, too,
      preconcerted to stand for certain meanings. And now, the tables removed,
      many a guest had gone away; a couple of youths <i>only</i> were <i>there</i>
      dead drunk. But then I saw you <i>both</i> giving wanton kisses; I am sure
      that there was billing enough on your part; such, <i>in fact</i>, as no
      sister gives to a brother of correct conduct, but <i>rather such</i> as
      some voluptuous mistress gives to the eager lover; such as we may suppose
      that Phoebus did not give to Diana, but that Venus many a time save to her
      own <i>dear</i> Mars.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing?" I cried out; "whither are you taking those
      transports that belong to me? On what belongs to myself, I will lay the
      hand of a master, <a href="#linknote-347" name="linknoteref-347"
      id="linknoteref-347"><small>347</small></a> These <i>delights</i> must be
      in common with you and me, <i>and</i> with me and you; <i>but</i> why does
      any third person take a share in them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This did I say; and what, <i>besides</i>, sorrow prompted my tongue to
      say; but the red blush of shame rose on her conscious features; just as
      the sky, streaked by the wife of Tithonus, is tinted with red, or the
      maiden when beheld by her new-made husband; <a href="#linknote-348"
      name="linknoteref-348" id="linknoteref-348"><small>348</small></a> just as
      the roses are beauteous when mingled among their <i>encircling</i> lilies;
      or when the Moon is suffering from the enchantment of her steeds; <a
      href="#linknote-349" name="linknoteref-349" id="linknoteref-349"><small>349</small></a>
      or the Assyrian ivory <a href="#linknote-350" name="linknoteref-350"
      id="linknoteref-350"><small>350</small></a> which the Mæonian woman has
      stained, <a href="#linknote-351" name="linknoteref-351"
      id="linknoteref-351"><small>351</small></a> that from length of time it
      may not turn yellow. That complexion <i>of hers</i> was extremely like to
      these, or to some one of these; and, as it happened, she never was more
      beauteous <i>than then</i>. She looked towards the ground; to look upon
      the ground, added a charm; sad were her features, in her sorrow was she
      graceful. I had been tempted to tear her locks just as they were, (and
      nicely dressed they were) and to make an attack upon her tender cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I looked on her face, my strong arms fell powerless; by arms of her
      own was my mistress defended. I, who the moment before had been so savage,
      <i>now</i>, as a suppliant and of my own accord, entreated that she would
      give me kisses not inferior <i>to those given-to my rival</i>. She smiled,
      and with heartiness she gave me her best <i>kisses</i>; such as might have
      snatched his three-forked bolts from Jove. To my misery I am <i>now</i>
      tormented, lest that other person received them in equal perfection; and I
      hope that those were not of this quality. <a href="#linknote-352"
      name="linknoteref-352" id="linknoteref-352"><small>352</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Those <i>kisses,</i> too, were far better than those which I taught her;
      and she seemed to have learned something new. That they were too
      delightful, is a bad sign; that so lovingly were your lips joined to mine,
      <i>and</i> mine to yours. And yet, it is not at this alone that I am
      grieved; I do not only complain that kisses were given; although I do
      complain as well that they were given; such could never have been taught
      but on a closer acquaintanceship. I know not who is the master that has
      received a remuneration so ample.

      with your hard claws disfigure your delicate features. Let your rough
      feathers be torn in place of your sorrowing hair; instead of the long
      trumpet, <a href="#linknote-354" name="linknoteref-354"

    <p>
      Why, Philomela, are you complaining of the cruelty of <i>Tereus,</i> the
      Ismarian tyrant? <i>Surely,</i> that grievance is worn out by its <i>length
      of</i> years. Turn your attention to the sad end of a bird so prized. It
      is is a great cause of sorrow, but, <i>still,</i> that so old. All, who
      poise yourselves in your career in the liquid air; but you, above the
      rest, affectionate turtle-dove, <a href="#linknote-360"
      name="linknoteref-360" id="linknoteref-360"><small>360</small></a> lament
      him. Throughout life there was a firm attachment between you, and your
      prolonged and lasting friendship endured to the end. What the Phocian
      youth <a href="#linknote-361" name="linknoteref-361" id="linknoteref-361"><small>361</small></a>
      was to the Argive Orestes, the same, parrot, was the turtle-dove to you,
      so long as it was allowed <i>by fate.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      But what <i>matters</i> that friendship? What the beauty of your rare
      plumage? What your voice so ingenious at imitating sounds? What avails it
      that <i>ever</i> since you were given, you pleased my mistress?
      Unfortunate pride of <i>all</i> birds, you are indeed laid low. With your
      feathers you could outvie the green emerald, having your purple beak
      tinted with the ruddy saffron. There was no bird on earth more skilled at
      imitating sounds; so prettily <a href="#linknote-362"
      name="linknoteref-362" id="linknoteref-362"><small>362</small></a> did you
      utter words with your lisping notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through envy, you were snatched away <i>from us</i>: you were the cause of
      no cruel wars; you were a chatterer, and the lover of peaceful concord.
      See, the quails, amid <i>all</i> their battles, <a href="#linknote-363"
      name="linknoteref-363" id="linknoteref-363"><small>363</small></a> live
      on; perhaps, too, for that reason, they become old. With a very little you
      were satisfied; and, through your love of talking, you could not give time
      to your mouth for much food. A nut was your food, and poppies the cause of
      sleep; and a drop of pure water used to dispel your thirst. The gluttonous
      vulture lives on, the kite, too, that forms its circles in the air, and
      the jackdaw, the foreboder <a href="#linknote-364" name="linknoteref-364"
      id="linknoteref-364"><small>364</small></a> of the shower of rain. The

      indeed, will hardly die after nine ages. <a href="#linknote-367"

      now Hector became ashes, while his brothers <i>yet</i> lived.

    <p>
      Why should I mention the affectionate prayers of my anxious mistress in
      your behalf; prayers borne over the seas by the stormy North wind? The
      seventh day was come, <a href="#linknote-369" name="linknoteref-369"
      id="linknoteref-369"><small>369</small></a> that was doomed to give no
      morrow; and now stood your Destiny, with her distaff all uncovered. And
      yet your words did not die away, in your faltering mouth; as you died,
      your tongue cried aloud, "Corinna, farewell!" <a href="#linknote-370"

      ones are expelled. There range far and wide the guiltless swans; the

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span> Cupid, never
      angered enough against me, O boy, that hast taken up thy abode in my
      heart! why dost thou torment me, who, <i>thy</i> soldier, have never
      deserted thy standards? And <i>why</i>, in my own camp, am I <i>thus</i>
      wounded? Why does thy torch burn, thy bow pierce, thy friends? 'Twere a
      greater glory to conquer those who war <i>with thee</i>. Nay more, did not
      the Hæmonian hero, afterwards, relieve him, when wounded, with his healing
      aid, whom he had struck with his spear. <a href="#linknote-390"

      hunter follows <i>the prey</i> that flies, that which is caught he leaves
      behind; and he is ever on the search for still more than he has found. We,
      a multitude devoted to thee, are <i>too well</i> acquainted with thy arms;
      <i>yet</i> thy tardy hand slackens against the foe that resists. Of what
      use is it to be blunting thy barbed darts against bare bones? <i>for</i>
      Love has left my bones <i>quite</i> bare. Many a man is there free from
      Love, many a damsel, too, free from Love; from these, with great glory,
      may a triumph be obtained by thee.

      Rome, had she not displayed her strength over the boundless earth, would,
      even to this day, have been planted thick with cottages of thatch. <a

      The invalid soldier is drafted off to the fields <a href="#linknote-392"
      name="linknoteref-392" id="linknoteref-392"><small>392</small></a> that he

      name="linknoteref-393" id="linknoteref-393"><small>393</small></a> is sent
      into the pastures; the lengthened docks conceal the ship laid up; and the
      wand of repose <a href="#linknote-394" name="linknoteref-394"
      id="linknoteref-394"><small>394</small></a> is demanded, the sword laid
      by. It were time for me, too, who have served so oft in love for the fair,
      now discharged, to be living in quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>And yet</i>, if any Divinity were to say to me, 'Live on, resigning
      love I should decline it; so sweet an evil are the fair. When I am quite
      exhausted, and the passion has faded from my mind, I know not by what
      perturbation of my wretched feelings I am bewildered. Just as the horse
      that is hard of mouth bears his master headlong, as he vainly pulls in the
      reins covered with foam; just as a sudden gale, the land now nearly made,
      carries out to sea the vessel, as she is entering harbour; so, many a
      time, does the uncertain gale of Cupid bear me away, and rosy Love resumes
      his well-known weapons. Pierce me, boy; naked am I exposed to thee, my
      arms laid aside; hither let thy strength be <i>directed</i>: here thy
      right hand tells <i>with effect</i>. Here, as though bidden, do thy arrows
      now spontaneously come; in comparison to myself, their own quiver is
      hardly so well known to them.

      Wretched is he who endures to rest the whole night, and who calls slumber
      a great good. Fool, what is slumber but the image of cold death? The Fates
      will give abundance of time for taking rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only let the words of my deceiving mistress beguile me; in hoping, at
      least, great joys shall I experience. And sometimes let her use caresses;
      sometimes let her find fault; oft may I enjoy <i>the favour</i> of my
      mistress; often may I be repulsed. That Mars is one so dubious, is through
      thee, his step-son, Cupid; and after thy example does thy step-father
      wield his arms. Thou art fickle, and much more wavering than thy own
      wings; and thou both dost give and refuse thy joys at thy uncertain
      caprice. Still if thou dost listen to me, as I entreat thee, with thy
      beauteous mother; hold a sway never to be relinquished in my heart. May
      the damsels, a throng too flighty <i>by far</i>, be added to thy realms;
      then by two peoples wilt thou be revered.

      without my arms. <a href="#linknote-396" name="linknoteref-396"

      impelled by the discordant breezes, and keep me distracted. Why, Erycina,

      my sluggish slumbers; and may I be not the solitary burden of my couch.
      May my mistress, with no one to hinder it, make me die <i>with love</i>,
      if one is enough to be able to do so; <i>but</i> if one is not enough, <i>then</i>
      two. Limbs that are thin, <a href="#linknote-401" name="linknoteref-401"
      id="linknoteref-401"><small>401</small></a> but not without strength, may
      suffice; flesh it is, not sinew that my body is in want of. Delight, too,
      will give resources for vigour to my sides; through me has no fair ever
      been deceived. Often, robust through the hours of delicious night, have I

      the heights of Pelion, was the first to teach the voyage full of danger,

      <a href="#linknote-404" name="linknoteref-404" id="linknoteref-404"><small>404</small></a>
      bore away the ram remarkable for his yellow fleece. Oh! would that,
      overwhelmed, the Argo had drunk of the fatal waves, so that no one might
      plough the wide main with the oar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lo! Corinna flies from both the well-known couch, and the Penates of her
      home, and prepares to go upon the deceitful paths <i>of the ocean</i>. Ah
      wretched me! why, for you, must I dread the Zephyrs, and the Eastern
      gales, and the cold Boreas, and the warm wind of the South? There no
      cities will you admire, <i>there</i> no groves; <i>ever</i> the same is
      the azure appearance of the perfidious main.
    </p>
    <p>
      The midst of the ocean has no tiny shells, or tinted pebbles; <a
      href="#linknote-405" name="linknoteref-405" id="linknoteref-405"><small>405</small></a>
      that is the recreation <a href="#linknote-406" name="linknoteref-406"
      id="linknoteref-406"><small>406</small></a> of the sandy shore. The shore
      <i>alone</i>, ye fair, should be pressed with your marble feet. Thus far
      is it safe; the rest of <i>that</i> path is full of hazard. And let others
      tell you of the warfare of the winds: the waves which Scylla infests, or
      those which Charybdis <i>haunts</i>: from what rocky range the deadly
      Ceraunia projects: in what gulf the Syrtes, or in what Malea <a
      href="#linknote-407" name="linknoteref-407" id="linknoteref-407"><small>407</small></a>
      lies concealed. Of these let others tell: but do you believe what each of
      them relates: no storm injures the person who credits them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a length of time <i>only</i> is the land beheld once more, when, the
      cable loosened, the curving ship runs out upon the boundless main: where
      the anxious sailor dreads the stormy winds, and <i>sees</i> death as near
      him, as he sees the waves. What if Triton arouses the agitated waves? How
      parts the colour, then, from all your face! Then you may invoke the
      gracious stars of the fruitful Leda: <a href="#linknote-409"
      name="linknoteref-409" id="linknoteref-409"><small>409</small></a> and may
      say, 'Happy she, whom her own <i>dry</i> land receives!'Tis far more safe
      to lie snug in the couch, <a href="#linknote-410" name="linknoteref-410"
      id="linknoteref-410"><small>410</small></a> to read amusing books, <a
      href="#linknote-411" name="linknoteref-411" id="linknoteref-411"><small>411</small></a>
      <i>and</i> to sound with one's fingers the Thracian lyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the headlong gales bear away my unavailing words, still may Galatea
      be propitious to your ship. The loss of such a damsel, both ye Goddesses,
      daughters of Nereus, and thou, father of the Nereids, would be a reproach
      to you. Go, mindful of me, on your way, <i>soon</i> to return with
      favouring breezes: may that, a stronger gale, fill your sails. Then may
      the mighty Nereus roll the ocean towards this shore: in this direction may
      the breezes blow: hither may the tide impel the waves. Do you yourself
      entreat, that the Zephyrs may come full upon your canvass: do you let out
      the swelling sails with your own hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall be the first, from the shore, to see the well-known ship, and I
      shall exclaim, "'Tis she that carries my Divinities: <a
      href="#linknote-412" name="linknoteref-412" id="linknoteref-412"><small>412</small></a>
      and I will receive you in my arms, and will ravish, indiscriminately, many
      a kiss; the victim, promised for your return, shall fall; the soft sand
      shall be heaped, too, in the form of a couch; and some sand-heap shall be
      as a table <a href="#linknote-413" name="linknoteref-413"
      id="linknoteref-413"><small>413</small></a> <i>for us</i>. There, with
      wine placed before us, you shall tell many a story, how your bark was
      nearly overwhelmed in the midst of the waves: and how, while you were
      hastening to me, you dreaded neither the hours of the dangerous night, nor
      yet the stormy Southern gales. Though they be fictions, <a
      href="#linknote-414" name="linknoteref-414" id="linknoteref-414"><small>414</small></a>
      <i>yet</i> all will I believe as truth; why should I not myself encourage

      id="linknoteref-441"><small>441</small></a> on the empty earth, for the
      second time the original of our kind. Who would have destroyed the

      the twins in her swelling womb, the founder of the all-ruling City would

      If Venus had laid violent hands on Æneas in her pregnant womb, the earth
      would have been destitute of <i>its</i> Cæsars. You, too, beauteous one,
      might have died at the moment you might have been born, if your mother had
      tried the same experiment which you have done. I, myself, though destined
      as I am, to die a more pleasing death by love, should have beheld no days,
      had my mother slain me.

      Why do you deprive the loaded vine of its growing grapes? And why pluck
      the sour apples with relentless hand? When ripe, let them fall of their
      own accord; <i>once</i> put forth, let them grow. Life is no slight reward
      for a little waiting. Why pierce <a href="#linknote-443"
      name="linknoteref-443" id="linknoteref-443"><small>443</small></a> your
      own entrails, by applying instruments, and <i>why</i> give dreadful
      poisons to the <i>yet</i> unborn? People blame the Colchian damsel,
      stained with the blood of her sons; and they grieve for Itys, Slaughtered
      by his own mother. Each mother was cruel; but each, for sad reasons, took
      vengeance on her husband, by shedding their common blood. Tell me what
      Tereus, or what Jason excites you to pierce your body with an anxious
      hand?

      This neither the tigers do in their Armenian dens, <a href="#linknote-444"
      name="linknoteref-444" id="linknoteref-444"><small>444</small></a> nor
      does the lioness dare to destroy an offspring of her own. But, delicate
      females do this, not, however, with impunity; many a time <a
      href="#linknote-445" name="linknoteref-445" id="linknoteref-445"><small>445</small></a>
      does she die herself, who kills her <i>offspring</i> in the womb. She dies
      herself, and, with her loosened hair, is borne upon the bier; and those
      whoever only catch a sight of her, cry "She deserved it." <a
      href="#linknote-446" name="linknoteref-446" id="linknoteref-446"><small>446</small></a>
      But let these words vanish in the air of the heavens, and may there be no
      weight in <i>these</i> presages of mine. Ye forgiving Deities, allow her
      this once to do wrong with safety <i>to herself</i>; that is enough; let a

      violence. And would that I had been the prize, too, of some indulgent
      mistress; since I was destined to be the prize of some fair. Beauty begets

      If your beauty gives you a sway not too great over all things, face born

      comparatively with yourself. That which is inferior must be united with
      what is great. The Nymph Calypso, seized with passion for a mortal, is

      and for this pursuit I was well prepared. Love smiled both at my tragic
      pall, and my coloured buskins, and the sceptre wielded so well by a
      private hand. From this pursuit, too, did the influence of my cruel
      mistress draw me away, and Love triumphed over the Poet with his buskins.
      As I am allowed <i>to do</i>, either I teach the art of tender love,
      (alas! by my own precepts am I myself tormented:) or I write what was
      delivered to Ulysses in the words of Penelope, or thy tears, deserted
      Phyllis. What, <i>too</i>, Paris and Macareus, and the ungrateful Jason,
      and the parent of Hip-polytus, and Hippolytus <i>himself</i> read: and

      stepmother read what was written by her own Hippolytus. Then did the
      dutiful Æneas write an answer to the afflicted Elissa; and Phyllis, if she
      only survives, has something to read. The sad letter came to Hypsipyle
      from Jason: the Lesbian damsel, beloved <i>by Apollo</i>, may give the
      lyre that she has vowed to Phoebus. <a href="#linknote-484"

      Love unsung of by thee, in the midst of warfare. Both Paris is there, and
      the adultress, the far-famed cause of guilt: and Laodamia, who attends her

      Why should I <i>think of</i> Fortune, should she never care to deceive me?
      I value nothing that does not sometimes cause me pain. The clever Corinna

      that was quite well, has she ordered me, as I lingered with tardy foot, to
      take my departure! Oh, how many a time has she feigned a fault, and guilty
      <i>herself,</i> has made there to be an appearance of innocence, just as
      she pleased! When thus she had tormented me and had rekindled the languid
      flame, again was she kind and obliging to my wishes. What caresses, what
      delightful words did she have ready for me! What kisses, ye great Gods,
      and how many, used she to give me!

      treachery, often, when entreated, refuse; and let me, lying prostrate on
      the threshold before your door-posts, endure the prolonged cold throughout
      the frosty night. Thus is my love made lasting, and it grows up in
      lengthened experience; this is for my advantage, this forms food for my
      affection. A surfeit of love, <a href="#linknote-486"
      name="linknoteref-486" id="linknoteref-486"><small>486</small></a> and
      facilities too great, become a cause of weariness to me, just as sweet
      food cloys the appetite. If the brazen tower had never enclosed Danaë, <a

      Danaë had never been made a mother by Jove. While Juno is watching Io

      Whoever desires what he may have, and what is easily obtained, let him

      name="linknoteref-488" id="linknoteref-488"><small>488</small></a> in the
      silent night. Whither the careful handmaid is carrying, or whence bringing
      back, the tablets? Why so oft she lies in her couch apart? Let this
      anxiety sometimes gnaw into thy very marrow; and give some scope and some
      opportunity for my stratagems.
    </p>
    <p>
      If one could fall in love with the wife of a fool, that man could rob the
      barren sea-shore of its sand. And now I give thee notice; unless thou
      begin to watch this fair, she shall begin to cease to be a flame of mine.
      I have put up with much, and that for a long time; I have often hoped that
      it would come to pass, that I should adroitly deceive thee, when thou
      hadst watched her well. Thou art careless, and dost endure what should be
      endured by no husband; but an end there shall be of an amour that is
      allowed to me. And shall I then, to my sorrow, forsooth, never be
      forbidden admission? Will it ever be night for me, with no one for an
      avenger? Am I to dread nothing? Shall I heave no sighs in my sleep? What
      have I to do with one so easy, what with such a pander of a husband? By
      thy own faultiness thou dost mar my joys. Why, then, dost thou not choose
      some one else, for so great long-suffering to please? If it pleases thee
      for me to be thy rival, forbid me <i>to be so</i>.&mdash;&mdash;

      ELEGY I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>The Poet deliberates whether he shall continue to write Elegies, or
      whether he shall turn to Tragedy.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here stands an
      ancient grove, and one uncut for many a year; 'tis worthy of belief that a
      Deity inhabits that spot. In the midst there is a holy spring, and a
      grotto arched with pumice; and on every side the birds pour forth their
      sweet complaints. Here, as I was walking, protected by the shade of the
      trees, I was considering upon what work my Muse should commence. Elegy
      came up, having her perfumed hair wreathed; and, if I mistake not, one of
      her feet was longer <i>than the other</i>. <a href="#linknote-501"
      name="linknoteref-501" id="linknoteref-501"><small>501</small></a> Her
      figure was beauteous; her robe of the humblest texture, her garb that of
      one in love; the fault of her foot was one cause of her gracefulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruthless Tragedy, too, came with her mighty stride; on her scowling brow
      were her locks; her pall swept the ground. Her left hand held aloft the
      royal sceptre; the Lydian buskin <a href="#linknote-502"
      name="linknoteref-502" id="linknoteref-502"><small>502</small></a> was the
      high sandal for her feet. And first she spoke; "And when will there be an
      end of thy loving? O Poet, so slow at thy subject matter! Drunken revels
      <a href="#linknote-503" name="linknoteref-503" id="linknoteref-503"><small>503</small></a>
      tell of thy wanton course of life; the cross roads, as they divide in
      their many ways, tell of it. Many a time does a person point with his
      finger at the Poet as he goes along, and say, 'That, that is the man whom
      cruel Love torments.' Thou art talked of as the story of the whole City,
      and yet thou dost not perceive it; while, all shame laid aside, thou art
      boasting of thy feats. 'Twere time to be influenced, touched by a more
      mighty inspiration; <a href="#linknote-505" name="linknoteref-505"
      id="linknoteref-505"><small>505</small></a> long enough hast thou delayed;
      commence a greater task. By thy subject thou dost cramp thy genius; sing
      of the exploits of heroes; then thou wilt say, 'This is the field that is
      worthy of my genius.' Thy Muse has sportively indited what the charming
      fair may sing; and thy early youth has been passed amidst its own numbers.
      Now may I, Roman Tragedy, gain a celebrity by thy means; thy conceptions
      will satisfy my requirements."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far <i>did she speak</i>; and, supported on her tinted buskins, three
      or four times she shook her head with its flowing locks. The other one, if
      rightly I remember, smiled with eyes askance. Am I mistaken, or was there
      a branch of myrtle in her right hand? "Why, haughty Tragedy," said she,
      "dost thou attack me with high-sounding words? And canst thou never be
      other than severe? Still, thou thyself hast deigned to be excited in
      unequal numbers! <a href="#linknote-506" name="linknoteref-506"
      id="linknoteref-506"><small>506</small></a> Against me hast thou strived,
      making use of my own verse. I should not compare heroic measures with my
      own; thy palaces quite overwhelm my humble abodes. I am a trifler; and
      with myself, Cupid, my care, is a trifler too; I am no more substantial
      myself than is my subject-matter. Without myself, the mother of wanton
      Love were coy; of that Goddess do I show myself the patroness <a
      href="#linknote-507" name="linknoteref-507" id="linknoteref-507"><small>507</small></a>
      and the confidant. The door which thou with thy rigid buskin canst not
      unlock, the same is open to my caressing words. And yet I have deserved
      more power than thou, by putting up with many a thing that would not have
      been endured by thy haughtiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Through me Corinna learned how, deceiving her keeper, to shake the
      constancy of the fastened door, <a href="#linknote-508"
      name="linknoteref-508" id="linknoteref-508"><small>508</small></a> and to
      slip away from her couch, clad in a loose tunic, <a href="#linknote-509"
      name="linknoteref-509" id="linknoteref-509"><small>509</small></a> and in
      the night to move her feet without a stumble. Or how often, cut in <i>the
      wood</i>, <a href="#linknote-510" name="linknoteref-510"
      id="linknoteref-510"><small>510</small></a> have I been hanging up at her
      obdurate doors, not fearing to be read by the people as they passed! I
      remember besides, how, when sent, I have been concealed in the bosom of
      the handmaid, until the strict keeper had taken his departure. Still
      further&mdash;when thou didst send me as a present on her birthday <a
      href="#linknote-511" name="linknoteref-511" id="linknoteref-511"><small>511</small></a>
      &mdash;but she tore me to pieces, and barbarously threw me in the water
      close by. I was the first to cause the prospering germs of thy genius to
      shoot; it has, as my gift, that for which she is now asking thee."
    </p>
    <p>
      They had now ceased; on which I began: "By your own selves, I conjure you
      both; let my words, as I tremble, be received by unprejudiced ears. Thou,
      the one, dost grace me with the sceptre and the lofty buskin; already,
      even by thy contact with my lips, have I spoken in mighty accents. Thou,
      the other, dost offer a lasting fame to my loves; be propitious, then, and
      with the long lines unite the short.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do, Tragedy, grant a little respite to the Poet. Thou art an everlasting
      task; the time which she demands is but short." Moved by my entreaties,
      she gave me leave; let tender Love be sketched with hurried hand, while
      still there is time; from behind <a href="#linknote-514"
      name="linknoteref-514" id="linknoteref-514"><small>514</small></a> a more
      weighty undertaking presses on.

    <p>
      <i>To his mistress, in whose company he is present at the chariot races in
      the Circus Maximus. He describes the race.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> am not sitting
      here <a href="#linknote-515" name="linknoteref-515" id="linknoteref-515"><small>515</small></a>
      an admirer of the spirited steeds; <a href="#linknote-516"
      name="linknoteref-516" id="linknoteref-516"><small>516</small></a> still I
      pray that he who is your favourite may win. I have come here to chat with
      you, and to be seated by you, <a href="#linknote-517"
      name="linknoteref-517" id="linknoteref-517"><small>517</small></a> that
      the passion which yea cause may not be unknown to you. You are looking at
      the race, I <i>am looking</i> at you; let us each look at what pleases us,
      and so let us each feast our eyes. O, happy the driver <a
      href="#linknote-518" name="linknoteref-518" id="linknoteref-518"><small>518</small></a>
      of the steeds, whoever he is, that is your favourite; it is then his lot
      to be the object of your care; might such be my lot; with ardent zeal to
      be borne along would I press over the steeds as they start from the sacred
      barrier. <a href="#linknote-519" name="linknoteref-519"
      id="linknoteref-519"><small>519</small></a> And now I would give rein; <a
      href="#linknote-520" name="linknoteref-520" id="linknoteref-520"><small>520</small></a>
      now with my whip would I lash their backs; now with my inside wheel would
      I graze the turning-place. <a href="#linknote-521" name="linknoteref-521"
      id="linknoteref-521"><small>521</small></a> If you should be seen by me in
      my course, then I should stop; and the reins, let go, would fall from my
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! how nearly was Pelops <a href="#linknote-522" name="linknoteref-522"
      id="linknoteref-522"><small>522</small></a> falling by the lance of him of
      Pisa, while, Hippodamia, he was gazing on thy face! Still did he prove the
      conqueror through the favour of his mistress; <a href="#linknote-523"
      name="linknoteref-523" id="linknoteref-523"><small>523</small></a> let us
      each prove victor through the favour of his charmer. Why do you shrink
      away in vain? <a href="#linknote-524" name="linknoteref-524"
      id="linknoteref-524"><small>524</small></a> The partition forces us to sit
      close; the Circus has this advantage <a href="#linknote-525"
      name="linknoteref-525" id="linknoteref-525"><small>525</small></a> in the
      arrangement of its space. But do you <a href="#linknote-526"
      name="linknoteref-526" id="linknoteref-526"><small>526</small></a> on the
      right hand, whoever you are, be accommodating to the fair; she is being
      hurt by the pressure of your side. And you as well, <a href="#linknote-527"
      name="linknoteref-527" id="linknoteref-527"><small>527</small></a> who are
      looking on behind us; draw in your legs, if you have <i>any</i> decency,
      and don't press her back with your hard knees. But your mantle, hanging
      too low, is dragging on the ground; gather it up; or see, I am taking it
      up <a href="#linknote-528" name="linknoteref-528" id="linknoteref-528"><small>528</small></a>
      in my hands. A disobliging garment you are, who are thus concealing ancles
      so pretty; and the more you gaze upon them, the more disobliging garment
      you are. Such were the ancles of the fleet Atalanta, <a
      href="#linknote-529" name="linknoteref-529" id="linknoteref-529"><small>529</small></a>
      which Milanion longed to touch with his hands. Such are painted the ancles
      of the swift Diana, when, herself <i>still</i> bolder, she pursues the
      bold beasts of prey. On not seeing them, I am on fire; what would be the
      consequence if they <i>were seen?</i> You are heaping flames upon flames,
      water upon the sea. From them I suspect that the rest may prove charming,
      which is so well hidden, concealed beneath the thin dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, meanwhile, should you like to receive the gentle breeze which the fan
      may cause, <a href="#linknote-530" name="linknoteref-530"
      id="linknoteref-530"><small>530</small></a> when waved by my hand? Or is
      the heat I feel, rather that of my own passion, and not of the weather,
      and is the love of the fair burning my inflamed breast? While I am
      talking, your white clothes are sprinkled with the black dust; nasty dust,
      away from a body like the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the procession <a href="#linknote-531" name="linknoteref-531"
      id="linknoteref-531"><small>531</small></a> is approaching; give good
      omens both in words and feelings. The time is come to applaud; the
      procession approaches, glistening with gold. First in place is Victory
      borne <a href="#linknote-532" name="linknoteref-532" id="linknoteref-532"><small>532</small></a>
      with expanded wings; <a href="#linknote-533" name="linknoteref-533"
      id="linknoteref-533"><small>533</small></a> come hither, Goddess, and
      grant that this passion of mine may prove victorious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Salute Neptune, <a href="#linknote-534" name="linknoteref-534"
      id="linknoteref-534"><small>534</small></a> you who put too much
      confidence in the waves; I have nought to do with the sea; my own dry land
      engages me. Soldier, salute thy own Mars; arms I detest <a
      href="#linknote-535" name="linknoteref-535" id="linknoteref-535"><small>535</small></a>
      Peace delights me, and Love found in the midst of Peace. Let Phoebus be
      propitious to the augurs, Phoebe to the huntsmen; turn, Minerva, towards
      thyself the hands of the artisan. <a href="#linknote-536"
      name="linknoteref-536" id="linknoteref-536"><small>536</small></a> Ye
      husbandmen, arise in honour of Ceres and the youthful Bacchus; let the
      boxers <a href="#linknote-537" name="linknoteref-537" id="linknoteref-537"><small>537</small></a>
      render Pollux, the horseman Castor propitious. Thee, genial Venus, and <i>the
      Loves</i>, the boys so potent with the bow, do I salute; be propitious,
      Goddess, to my aspirations. Inspire, too, kindly feelings in my new
      mistress; let her permit herself to be loved." She has assented; and with
      her nod she has given a favourable sign. What the Goddess has promised, I
      entreat yourself to promise. With the leave of Venus I will say it, you
      shall be the greater Goddess. By these many witnesses do I swear to you,
      and by this array of the Gods, that for all time you have been sighed for
      by me. But your legs have no support; you can, if perchance you like, rest
      the extremities of your feet in the lattice work. <a href="#linknote-538"
      name="linknoteref-538" id="linknoteref-538"><small>538</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the Prætor, <a href="#linknote-539" name="linknoteref-539"
      id="linknoteref-539"><small>539</small></a> the Circus emptied, has sent
      from the even barriers <a href="#linknote-540" name="linknoteref-540"
      id="linknoteref-540"><small>540</small></a> the chariots with their four
      steeds, the greatest sight of all. I see who is your favourite; whoever
      you wish well to, he will prove the conqueror. The very horses appear to
      understand what it is you wish for. Oh shocking! around the turning-place
      he goes with a circuit <i>far too</i> wide. <a href="#linknote-541"
      name="linknoteref-541" id="linknoteref-541"><small>541</small></a> What
      art thou about? The next is overtaking thee with his wheel in contact.
      What, wretched man, art thou about? Thou art wasting the good wishes of
      the fair; pull in the reins, I entreat, to the left, <a
      href="#linknote-542" name="linknoteref-542" id="linknoteref-542"><small>542</small></a>
      with a strong hand. We have been resting ourselves in a blockhead; but
      still, Romans, call him back again, <a href="#linknote-543"
      name="linknoteref-543" id="linknoteref-543"><small>543</small></a> and by
      waving the garments, <a href="#linknote-544" name="linknoteref-544"
      id="linknoteref-544"><small>544</small></a> give the signal on every side.
      See! they are calling him back; but that the waving of the garments may
      not disarrange your hair, <a href="#linknote-545" name="linknoteref-545"
      id="linknoteref-545"><small>545</small></a> you may hide yourself quite
      down in my bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, the barrier <a href="#linknote-546" name="linknoteref-546"
      id="linknoteref-546"><small>546</small></a> unbarred once more, the side
      posts are open wide; with the horses at full speed the variegated throng
      <a href="#linknote-547" name="linknoteref-547" id="linknoteref-547"><small>547</small></a>
      bursts forth. This time, at all events, <a href="#linknote-548"
      name="linknoteref-548" id="linknoteref-548"><small>548</small></a> do
      prove victorious, and bound over the wide expanse; let my wishes, let
      those of my mistress, meet with success. The wishes of my mistress are
      fulfilled; my wishes still exist. He bears away the palm; <a
      href="#linknote-549" name="linknoteref-549" id="linknoteref-549"><small>549</small></a>
      the palm is yet to be sought by me. She smiles, and she gives me a promise
      of something with her expressive eye. That is enough for this spot; grant
      the rest in another place.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>o to, believe that
      the Gods exist; she who had sworn has broken her faith, and still her
      beauty remains <a href="#linknote-550" name="linknoteref-550"
      id="linknoteref-550"><small>550</small></a> just as it was before. Not yet
      forsworn, flowing locks had she; after she has deceived the Gods, she has
      them just as long. Before, she was pale, having her fair complexion
      suffused with the blush of the rose; the blush is still beauteous on her
      complexion of snow. Her foot was small; still most diminutive is the size
      of that foot. Tall was she, and graceful; tall and graceful does she still
      remain. Expressive eyes had she, which shone like stars; many a time
      through them has the treacherous fair proved false to me. <a
      href="#linknote-551" name="linknoteref-551" id="linknoteref-551"><small>551</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the Gods, forsooth, for ever permit the fair to be forsworn, and
      beauty has its divine sway. <a href="#linknote-552" name="linknoteref-552"
      id="linknoteref-552"><small>552</small></a> I remember that of late she

      Tell me, ye Gods, if with impunity she has proved false to you, why have I
      suffered, punishment for the deserts of another? But the virgin daughter
      of Cepheus is no reproach, <i>forsooth</i>, to you, <a href="#linknote-554"
      name="linknoteref-554" id="linknoteref-554"><small>554</small></a> who was
      commanded to die for her mother, so inopportunely beauteous. 'Tis not
      enough that I had you for witnesses to no purpose; unpunished, she laughs
      at even the Gods together with myself; that by my punishment she may atone
      for her perjuries, am I, the deceived, to be the victim of the deceiver?
      Either a Divinity is a name without reality, and he is revered in vain,
      and influences people with a silly credulity; or else, <i>if there is any</i>
      God, he is fond of the charming fair, and gives them alone too much
      licence to be able to do any thing.

    <p>
      Against us Mavors is girded with the fatal sword; against us the lance is
      directed by the invincible hand of Pallas; against us the flexible bow of
      Apollo is bent; against us the lofty right hand of Jove wields the
      lightnings. The offended Gods of heaven fear to hurt the fair; and they
      spontaneously dread those who dread them not. And who, then, would take
      care to place the frankincense in his devotion upon the altars? At least,
      there ought to be more spirit in men. Jupiter, with his fires, hurls at
      the groves <a href="#linknote-555" name="linknoteref-555"
      id="linknoteref-555"><small>555</small></a> and the towers, and yet he
      forbids his weapons, thus darted, to strike the perjured female. Many a
      one has deserved to be struck. The unfortunate Semele <a
      href="#linknote-556" name="linknoteref-556" id="linknoteref-556"><small>556</small></a>
      perished by the flames; that punishment was found for her by her own
      compliant disposition. But if she had betaken herself off, on the approach
      of her lover, his father would not have had for Bacchus the duties of a
      mother to perform.

      Why do I complain, and why blame all the heavens? The Gods have eyes as
      well as we; the Gods have hearts as well. Were I a Divinity myself, I
      would allow a woman with impunity to swear falsely by my Godhead. I myself
      would swear that the fair ever swear the truth; and I would not be
      pronounced one of the morose Divinities. Still, do you, fair one, use
      their favour with more moderation, or, at least, do have some regard <a
      href="#linknote-557" name="linknoteref-557" id="linknoteref-557"><small>557</small></a>

      Not through her beauty is she captivating, but through the fondness of her
      husband; people suppose it to be something unusual which has so captivated
      thee. Suppose she is not chaste whom her husband is guarding, but
      faithless; she is beloved; but this apprehension itself causes her value,
      rather than her beauty. Be indignant if thou dost please; forbidden
      pleasures delight me: if any woman can only say, "I am afraid, that woman
      alone pleases me. Nor yet is it legal <a href="#linknote-561"
      name="linknoteref-561" id="linknoteref-561"><small>561</small></a> to
      confine a free-born woman; let these fears harass the bodies of those from
      foreign parts. That the keeper, forsooth, may be able to say, 'I caused it
      she must be chaste for the credit of thy slave. He is too much of a churl
      whom a faithless wife injures, and is not sufficiently acquainted with the
      ways of the City; in which Romulus, the son of Ilia, and Remus, the son of
      Ilia, both begotten by Mars, were not born without a crime being
      committed. Why didst thou choose a beauty for thyself, if she was not
      pleasing unless chaste? Those two qualities <a href="#linknote-562"

      If thou art wise, show indulgence to thy spouse, and lay aside thy morose
      looks; and assert not the rights of a severe husband. Show courtesy, too,
      to the friends thy wife shall find thee, and many a one will she find.
      'Tis thus that great credit accrues at a very small outlay of labour. Thus

      <i>A vision, and its explanation.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>was night, and
      sleep weighed down my wearied eyes. Such a vision as this terrified my
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath a sunny hill, a grove was standing, thick set with holm oaks; and
      in its branches lurked full many a bird. A level spot there was beneath,
      most verdant with the grassy mead, moistened with the drops of the gently
      trickling stream. Beneath the foliage of the trees, I was seeking shelter
      from the heat; still, under the foliage of the trees it was hot. Lo!
      seeking for the grass mingled with the variegated flowers, a white cow was
      standing before my eyes; more white than the snows at the moment when they
      have just fallen, which, time has not yet turned into flowing water. More
      white than the milk which is white with its bubbling foam, <a
      href="#linknote-564" name="linknoteref-564" id="linknoteref-564"><small>564</small></a>
      and at that moment leaves the ewe when milked. <a href="#linknote-565"
      name="linknoteref-565" id="linknoteref-565"><small>565</small></a> A bull
      there was, her companion, he, in his happiness, eas her mate; and with his
      own one he pressed the tender grass. While he was lying, and slowly
      ruminating upon the grass chewed once again; and once again was feeding on
      the food eaten by him before; he seemed, as sleep took away his strength,
      to lay his horned head upon the ground that supported it. Hither came a
      crow, gliding through the air on light wings; and chattering, took her
      seat upon the green sward; and thrice with her annoying beak did she peck
      at the breast of the snow-white cow; and with her bill she took away the
      white hair. Having remained awhile, she left the spot and the bull; but
      black envy was in the breast of the cow. And when she saw the bulls afar
      browsing upon the pastures (bulls were browsing afar upon the verdant
      pastures), thither did she betake herself, and she mingled among those
      herds, and sought out a spot of more fertile grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, tell me, whoever thou art, thou interpreter of the dreams of the
      night, what (if it has any truth) this vision means." Thus said I: thus
      spoke the interpreter of the dreams of the night, as he weighed in his
      mind each particular that was seen; "The heat which thou didst wish to
      avoid beneath the rustling leaves, but didst but poorly avoid, was that of
      Love. The cow is thy mistress; that complexion is suited to the fair. Thou
      wast the male, and the bull with the fitting mate. Inasmuch as the crow
      pecked at her breast with her sharp beak; an old hag of a procuress <a
      href="#linknote-566" name="linknoteref-566" id="linknoteref-566"><small>566</small></a>
      will tempt the affections of thy mistress. In that, after hesitating long,
      his heifer left the bull, thou wilt be left to be chilled in a deserted
      couch. Envy and the black spots below the front of her breast, show that
      she is not free from the reproach of inconstancy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus spoke the interpreter; the blood retreated from my chilled face; and
      profound night stood before my eyes.

      to carry one over without the stroke of the oar, by means of the rope
      thrown across. Thou wast a small stream, I recollect; and I did not
      hesitate to pass across thee; and the surface of thy waves then hardly
      reached to my ancles. Now, from the opposite mountain <a
      href="#linknote-569" name="linknoteref-569" id="linknoteref-569"><small>569</small></a>
      thou dost rush, the snows being melted, and in thy turbid stream thou dost

      If still I must be standing here; if, by no contrivance, thy opposite
      banks are granted to be trodden by my foot.

    <p>
      Now do I long for the wings which the hero, the son of Danaë, <a
      href="#linknote-570" name="linknoteref-570" id="linknoteref-570"><small>570</small></a>
      possessed, when he bore away the head, thickset with the dreadful

      name="linknoteref-571" id="linknoteref-571"><small>571</small></a> from
      which the seed of Ceres first came, thrown upon the uncultivated ground.
      Of the wondrous fictions of the ancient poets do I speak; no time has
      produced, nor does produce, nor will produce these wonders. Rather, do
      thou, stream that dost overflow thy wide banks, flow within thy limits,
      then for ever mayst thou run on. Torrent, thou wilt not, believe me, be
      able to endure the reproaches, if perchance I should be mentioned as
      detained by thee in my love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rivers ought rather to aid youths in their loves; rivers themselves have
      experienced what love is. Inachus <a href="#linknote-572"
      name="linknoteref-572" id="linknoteref-572"><small>572</small></a> is said
      to have flowed pale with love for Melie, <a href="#linknote-573"
      name="linknoteref-573" id="linknoteref-573"><small>573</small></a> the
      Bithynian Nymph, and to have warmed throughout his cold fords. Not yet was
      Troy besieged for twice five years, when, Xanthus, Neæra attracted thy
      eyes. Besides; did not enduring love for the Arcadian maid force Alpheus
      <a href="#linknote-574" name="linknoteref-574" id="linknoteref-574"><small>574</small></a>
      to run through various lands? They say, too, that thou, Peneus, didst
      conceal, in the lands of the Phthiotians, Creüsa, <a href="#linknote-575"
      name="linknoteref-575" id="linknoteref-575"><small>575</small></a> already
      betrothed to Xanthus. Why should I mention Asopus, whom Thebe, beloved by
      Mars, <a href="#linknote-576" name="linknoteref-576" id="linknoteref-576"><small>576</small></a>
      received, Thebe, destined to be the parent of five daughters? Should I ask
      of Achelous, "Where now are thy horns?" thou wouldst complain that they
      were broken away by the wrathful hand of Hercules. <a href="#linknote-577"
      name="linknoteref-577" id="linknoteref-577"><small>577</small></a> Not of
      such value was Calydon, <a href="#linknote-578" name="linknoteref-578"
      id="linknoteref-578"><small>578</small></a> nor of such value was the
      whole of Ætolia; still, of such value was Deianira alone. The enriching
      Nile, that flows through his seven mouths, who so well conceals the native
      spot <a href="#linknote-579" name="linknoteref-579" id="linknoteref-579"><small>579</small></a>
      of waters so vast, is said not to have been able to overpower by his
      stream the flame that was kindled by Evadne, the daughter of Asopus. <a
      href="#linknote-580" name="linknoteref-580" id="linknoteref-580"><small>580</small></a>
      Enipeus, dried up, <a href="#linknote-581" name="linknoteref-581"
      id="linknoteref-581"><small>581</small></a> that he might be enabled to
      embrace the daughter of Salmoneus, bade his waters to depart; his waters,
      so ordered, did depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor do I pass thee by, who as thou dost roll amid the hollow rocks,
      foaming, dost water the fields of Argive Tibur <a href="#linknote-582"
      name="linknoteref-582" id="linknoteref-582"><small>582</small></a> whom
      Ilia <a href="#linknote-583" name="linknoteref-583" id="linknoteref-583"><small>583</small></a>
      captivated, although she was unsightly in her garb, bearing the marks of
      her nails on her locks, the marks of her nails on her cheeks. Bewailing
      both the crimes of her uncle, and the fault of Mars, she was wandering
      along the solitary spots with naked feet. Her the impetuous stream beheld
      from his rapid waves, and raised his hoarse mouth from the midst of his
      fords, and thus he said: "Why, in sorrow, art thou pacing my banks, Ilia,
      the descendant of Laomedon <a href="#linknote-584" name="linknoteref-584"
      id="linknoteref-584"><small>584</small></a> of Ida? Whither have gone thy
      vestments? Why wandering thus alone? And why does no white fillet <a
      href="#linknote-585" name="linknoteref-585" id="linknoteref-585"><small>585</small></a>
      bind thy hair tied up? Why weepest thou, and why spoil thy eyes wet with
      tears? And why beat thy open breast with frenzied hand? That man has both
      flints and ore of iron in his breast, who, unconcerned, beholds the tears
      on thy delicate face. Ilia, lay aside thy fears; my palace shall be opened
      unto thee; the streams, too, shall obey thee; Ilia, lay aside thy fears.
      Among a hundred Nymphs or more, thou shalt hold the sway; for a hundred or
      more does my stream contain. Only, descendant of Troy, despise me not, I
      pray; gifts more abundant than my promises shalt thou receive."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Thus</i> he said; she casting on the ground her modest eyes, as she
      wept, besprinkled her warm breast with her tears. Thrice did she attempt
      to fly; thrice did she stop short at the deep waves, as fear deprived her
      of the power of running. Still, at last, as with hostile fingers she tore
      her hair, with quivering lips she uttered these bitter words; "Oh! would
      that my bones had been gathered up, and hidden in the tomb of my fathers,
      while yet they could be gathered, belonging to me a virgin! Why now, am I
      courted <a href="#linknote-586" name="linknoteref-586" id="linknoteref-586"><small>586</small></a>
      for any nuptials, a Vestal disgraced, and to be driven from the altars of
      Ilium? Why do I hesitate? See! by the fingers of the multitude am I
      pointed at as unchaste. Let this disgrace be ended, which marks my
      features."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far <i>did she speak</i>, and before her swollen eyes she extended
      her robe; and so, in her despair, did she throw herself <a
      href="#linknote-587" name="linknoteref-587" id="linknoteref-587"><small>587</small></a>
      into the rapid waters. The flowing stream is said to have placed his hands
      beneath her breast, and to have conferred on her the privilege of his
      nuptial couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tis worthy of belief, too, that thou hast been inflamed <i>with love</i>
      for some maiden; but the groves and woods conceal thy failings.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I have been talking, it has become more swollen with its extending
      waves, and the deep channel contains not the rushing waters. What, furious
      torrent, hast thou against me? Why thus delay our mutual transports? Why,
      churlish river, interrupt the journey once commenced? What if thou didst
      flow according to some fixed rule, <a href="#linknote-588"
      name="linknoteref-588" id="linknoteref-588"><small>588</small></a> a river
      of some note? What if thy fame was mighty throughout the earth? But no
      name hast thou collected from the exhausted rivulets; thou hast no
      springs, no certain abode hast thou. In place of spring, thou hast rain
      and melted snow; resources which the sluggish winter supplies to thee.
      Either in muddy guise, in winter time, thou dost speed onward in thy
      course; or filled with dust, thou dost pass over the parched ground. What
      thirsty traveller has been able to drink of thee then? Who has said, with
      grateful lips, "Mayst thou flow on for ever?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Onward</i> thou dost run, injurious to the flocks, <a
      href="#linknote-589" name="linknoteref-589" id="linknoteref-589"><small>589</small></a>
      still more injurious to the fields. Perhaps these <i>mischiefs may move</i>
      others; my own evils move me. And, oh shocking! did I in my madness relate
      to this stream the loves of the rivers? I am ashamed unworthily to have
      pronounced names so great. Gazing on I know not what, could I speak of the
      rivers <a href="#linknote-590" name="linknoteref-590" id="linknoteref-590"><small>590</small></a>
      Acheloüs and Inachus, and could I, Nile, talk of thy name? But for thy
      deserts, torrent far from clear, I wish that for thee there may be
      scorching heat, and winter always dry.

      she gives the preference to a wealthy rival.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nd does any one
      still venerate the liberal arts, or suppose that soft verses have any
      merit? Genius once was more precious than gold; but now, to be possessed
      of nought is the height of ignorance. After my poems <a
      href="#linknote-591" name="linknoteref-591" id="linknoteref-591"><small>591</small></a>
      have proved very pleasing to my mistress, it is not allowed me to go where
      it has been allowed my books. When she has much bepraised me, her door is
      shut on him who is praised; talented <i>though I be</i>, I disgracefully
      wander up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold! a Knight gorged with blood, lately enriched, his wealth acquired
      <a href="#linknote-592" name="linknoteref-592" id="linknoteref-592"><small>592</small></a>
      through his wounds, <a href="#linknote-593" name="linknoteref-593"
      id="linknoteref-593"><small>593</small></a> is preferred before myself.
      And can you, my life, enfold him in your charming arms? Can you, my life,
      rush into his embrace? If you know it not, that head used to wear a
      helmet; that side which is so at your service, was girded with a sword.
      That left hand, which thus late <a href="#linknote-594"
      name="linknoteref-594" id="linknoteref-594"><small>594</small></a> the
      golden ring so badly suits, used to bear the shield; touch his right, it
      has been stained with blood. And can you touch that right hand, by which
      some person has met his death? Alas! where is that tenderness of heart of
      yours? Look at his scars, the traces of his former fights; whatever he
      possesses, by that body was it acquired. <a href="#linknote-595"
      name="linknoteref-595" id="linknoteref-595"><small>595</small></a>
      Perhaps, too, he will tell how often he has stabbed a man; covetous one,
      will you touch the hand that confesses this? I, unstained, the priest of
      the Muses and of Phoebus, am he who is singing his bootless song before
      your obdurate doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learn, you who are wise, not what we idlers know, but how to follow the
      anxious troops, and the ruthless camp; instead of good verses hold sway
      over <a href="#linknote-596" name="linknoteref-596" id="linknoteref-596"><small>596</small></a>
      the first rank; through this, Homer, hadst thou wished it, she might have
      proved kind to thee. Jupiter, well aware that nothing is more potent than
      gold, was himself the reward of the ravished damsel. <a
      href="#linknote-597" name="linknoteref-597" id="linknoteref-597"><small>597</small></a>
      So long as the bribe was wanting, the father was obdurate, she herself
      prudish, the door-posts bound with brass, the tower made of iron; but
      after the knowing seducer resorted to presents, <a href="#linknote-598"
      name="linknoteref-598" id="linknoteref-598"><small>598</small></a> she
      herself opened her lap; and, requested to surrender, she did surrender.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the aged Saturn held the realms of the heavens, the ground kept
      all money deep in its recesses. To the shades below had he removed brass
      and silver, and, together with gold, the weight of iron; and no ingots
      were there <i>in those times</i>. But she used to give what was better,
      corn without the crooked plough-share, apples too, and honey found in the
      hollow oak. And no one used with sturdy plough to cleave the soil; with no
      boundaries <a href="#linknote-599" name="linknoteref-599"
      id="linknoteref-599"><small>599</small></a> did the surveyor mark out the
      ground. The oars dipped down did not skim the upturned waves; then was the
      shore <a href="#linknote-601" name="linknoteref-601" id="linknoteref-601"><small>601</small></a>
      the limit of the paths of men. Human nature, against thyself hast thou
      been so clever; and for thy own destruction too ingenious. To what purpose
      surround cities with turreted fortifications? <a href="#linknote-602"
      name="linknoteref-602" id="linknoteref-602"><small>602</small></a> To what
      purpose turn hostile hands to arms? What hast thou to do with the sea?
      With the earth thou mightst have been content. Why not seek the heavens <a
      href="#linknote-603" name="linknoteref-603" id="linknoteref-603"><small>603</small></a>
      as well, for a third realm? To the heavens, too, dost thou aspire, so far
      as thou mayst. Quirinus, Liber, and Alcides, and Caesar but recently, <a
      href="#linknote-604" name="linknoteref-604" id="linknoteref-604"><small>604</small></a>
      have their temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of corn, we dig the solid gold from the earth; the soldier
      possesses riches acquired by blood. To the poor is the Senate-house <a
      href="#linknote-605" name="linknoteref-605" id="linknoteref-605"><small>605</small></a>
      shut; wealth alone confers honours; <a href="#linknote-606"
      name="linknoteref-606" id="linknoteref-606"><small>606</small></a> hence,
      the judge so grave; hence the knight so proud. Let them possess it all;
      let the field of Mars <a href="#linknote-607" name="linknoteref-607"
      id="linknoteref-607"><small>607</small></a> and the Forum <a
      href="#linknote-608" name="linknoteref-608" id="linknoteref-608"><small>608</small></a>
      obey them; let these administer peace and cruel warfare. Only, in their
      greediness, let them not tear away my mistress; and 'tis enough, so they
      but allow something to belong to the poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now-a-days, he that is able to give away plenty, rules it <i>over a
      woman</i> like a slave, even should she equal the prudish Sabine dames.
      The keeper is in my way; with regard to me, <a href="#linknote-609"
      name="linknoteref-609" id="linknoteref-609"><small>609</small></a> she
      dreads her husband. If I were to make presents, both of them would
      entirely disappear from the house. Oh! if any God is the avenger of the
      neglected lover, may he change riches, so ill-gotten, into dust.

    <p>
      <i>He laments the death of the Poet Tibullus.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>f his mother has
      lamented Memnon, his mother Achilles, and if sad deaths influence the
      great Goddesses; plaintive Elegy, unbind thy sorrowing tresses; alas! too
      nearly will thy name be derived from fact! The Poet of thy own
      inspiration, <a href="#linknote-610" name="linknoteref-610"
      id="linknoteref-610"><small>610</small></a> Tibullus, thy glory, is
      burning, a lifeless body, on the erected pile. <a href="#linknote-611"
      name="linknoteref-611" id="linknoteref-611"><small>611</small></a> Lo! the
      son of Venus bears both his quiver inverted, and his bow broken, and his
      torch without a flame; behold how wretched with drooping wings he goes:
      and how he beats his naked breast with cruel hand. His locks dishevelled
      about his neck receive his tears, and his mouth resounds with sobs that
      convulse his body. 'Twas thus, beauteous Iulus, they say that thou didst
      go forth from thy abode, at the funeral of his brother Æneas. Not less was
      Venus afflicted when Tibullus died, than when the cruel boar <a
      href="#linknote-612" name="linknoteref-612" id="linknoteref-612"><small>612</small></a>
      tore the groin of the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet we Poets are called 'hallowed,' and the care of the Deities; there
      are some, too, who believe that we possess inspiration. <a
      href="#linknote-613" name="linknoteref-613" id="linknoteref-613"><small>613</small></a>
      Inexorable Death, forsooth, profanes all that is hallowed; upon all she
      lays her <a href="#linknote-614" name="linknoteref-614"
      id="linknoteref-614"><small>614</small></a> dusky hands. What availed his
      father, what, his mother, for Ismarian Orpheus <a href="#linknote-615"
      name="linknoteref-615" id="linknoteref-615"><small>615</small></a> What,
      with his songs to have lulled the astounded wild beasts? The same father
      is said, in the lofty woods, to have sung 'Linus! Alas! Linus! Alas! <a
      href="#linknote-616" name="linknoteref-616" id="linknoteref-616"><small>616</small></a>
      to his reluctant lyre. Add the son of Mæon, <a href="#linknote-617"
      name="linknoteref-617" id="linknoteref-617"><small>617</small></a> too, by
      whom, as though an everlasting stream, the mouths of the poets are
      refreshed by the waters of Piëria: him, too, has his last day overwhelmed
      in black Avernus; his verse alone escapes the all-consuming pile. The fame
      of the Trojan toils, the work of the Poets is lasting, and the slow web
      woven <a href="#linknote-618" name="linknoteref-618" id="linknoteref-618"><small>618</small></a>
      again through the stratagem of the night. So shall Nemesis, so Delia, <a
      href="#linknote-619" name="linknoteref-619" id="linknoteref-619"><small>619</small></a>
      have a lasting name; the one, his recent choice, the other his first love.
    </p>
    <p>
      What does sacrifice avail thee? <a href="#linknote-620"
      name="linknoteref-620" id="linknoteref-620"><small>620</small></a> Of what
      use are now the 'sistra' of Egypt? What, lying apart <a
      href="#linknote-621" name="linknoteref-621" id="linknoteref-621"><small>621</small></a>
      in a forsaken bed? When the cruel Destinies snatch away the good, (pardon
      the confession) I am tempted to think that there are no Deities. Live
      piously; pious <i>though you be</i>, you shall die; attend the sacred
      worship; <i>still</i> ruthless Death shall drag the worshipper from the
      temples to the yawning tomb. <a href="#linknote-622" name="linknoteref-622"
      id="linknoteref-622"><small>622</small></a> Put your trust in the
      excellence of your verse; see! Tibullus lies prostrate; of so much, there
      hardly remains <i>enough</i> for a little urn to receive.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, hallowed Poet, have the flames of the pile consumed thee, and have
      they not been afraid to feed upon that heart of thine? They could have
      burned the golden temples of the holy Gods, that have dared a crime so
      great. She turned away her face, who holds the towers of Eryx; <a
      href="#linknote-623" name="linknoteref-623" id="linknoteref-623"><small>623</small></a>
      there are some, too, who affirm that she did not withhold her tears. But
      still, this is better than if the Phæacian land <a href="#linknote-624"
      name="linknoteref-624" id="linknoteref-624"><small>624</small></a> had
      buried him a stranger, in an ignoble spot. Here, <a href="#linknote-625"
      name="linknoteref-625" id="linknoteref-625"><small>625</small></a> at
      least, a mother pressed his tearful eyes <a href="#linknote-626"
      name="linknoteref-626" id="linknoteref-626"><small>626</small></a> as he
      fled, and presented the last gifts <a href="#linknote-627"
      name="linknoteref-627" id="linknoteref-627"><small>627</small></a> to his
      ashes; here a sister came to share the grief with her wretched mother,
      tearing her unadorned locks. And with thy relatives, both Nemesis and thy
      first love <a href="#linknote-628" name="linknoteref-628"
      id="linknoteref-628"><small>628</small></a> joined their kisses; and they
      left not the pile in solitude. Delia, as she departed, said, "More
      fortunately was I beloved by thee; so long as I was thy flame, thou didst
      live." To her said Nemesis: "What dost thou say? Are my sufferings a pain
      to thee? When dying, he grasped me with his failing hand." <a
      href="#linknote-629" name="linknoteref-629" id="linknoteref-629"><small>629</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      If, however, aught of us remains, but name and spirit, Tibullus will exist
      in the Elysian vales. Go to meet him, learned Catullus, <a
      href="#linknote-630" name="linknoteref-630" id="linknoteref-630"><small>630</small></a>
      with thy Calvus, having thy youthful temples bound with ivy. Thou too,
      Gallus, (if the accusation of the injury of thy friend is false) prodigal
      of thy blood <a href="#linknote-631" name="linknoteref-631"
      id="linknoteref-631"><small>631</small></a> and of thy life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of these, thy shade is the companion; if only there is any shade of the
      body, polished Tibullus; thou hast swelled the blessed throng. Rest,
      bones, I pray, in quiet, in the untouched urn; and may the earth prove not
      heavy for thy ashes.

      with ears of corn, why dost thou interfere with my pleasures by thy rites?
      Thee, Goddess, nations speak of as bounteous everywhere: and no one is
      less unfavorable to the blessings of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In former times the uncouth peasants did not parch the corn; and the
      threshing floor was a name unknown on earth. But the oaks, the early
      oracles, <a href="#linknote-633" name="linknoteref-633"
      id="linknoteref-633"><small>633</small></a> used to bear acorns; these,
      and the grass of the shooting sod, were the food of men. Ceres was the
      first to teach the seed to swell in the fields, and with the sickle did
      she cut her coloured locks; she first forced the bulls to place their
      necks beneath the yoke; and she with crooked tooth turned up the fallow
      ground. Can any one believe that she takes delight in the tears of lovers,
      and is duly propitiated with misery and single-blessedness? Nor yet
      (although she loves the fruitful fields) is she a coy one; nor lias she a
      breast devoid of love. The Cretans shall be my witnesses; and the Cretans
      do not feign everything; the Cretans, a nation proud of having nurtured
      Jove. <a href="#linknote-634" name="linknoteref-634" id="linknoteref-634"><small>634</small></a>
      There, he who rules the starry citadel of the world, a little child, drank
      milk with tender lips. There is full confidence in the witness; by its
      foster-child the witness is recommended I think that Ceres will confess
      her frailties, so well known.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Goddess had beheld Iasius <a href="#linknote-635"
      name="linknoteref-635" id="linknoteref-635"><small>635</small></a> at the
      foot of Cretan Ida, as he pierced the backs of the wild beasts with
      unerring hand. She beheld, and when her tender marrow caught the flame; on
      the one side Shame, on the other Love, inflamed her. Shame was conquered
      by Love; you might see the furrows lying dry, and the crops coming up with
      a very small proportion of their wheat. <a href="#linknote-636"
      name="linknoteref-636" id="linknoteref-636"><small>636</small></a> When
      the mattocks stoutly wielded had turned up the land, and the crooked
      plough had broken the hard earth, and the seed had fallen equally
      scattered over the wide fields; the hopes of the deceived husbandman were
      vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Goddess, the guardian of corn, was lingering in the lofty woods; the
      wreaths of com had fallen from her flowing locks. Crete alone was fertile
      in its fruitful year; all places, whither the Goddess had betaken herself,
      were one continued harvest. Ida, the locality itself for groves, grew
      white with corn, and the wild boar cropped the ears in the woods. The
      law-giving Minos <a href="#linknote-637" name="linknoteref-637"
      id="linknoteref-637"><small>637</small></a> wished for himself many like
      years; he wished that the love of Ceres might prove lasting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, yellow-haired Goddess, single-blessedness would have been sad to
      thee; this am I now compelled by thy rites to endure. Why should I be sad,
      when thy daughter has been found again by thee, and rules over realms,
      only less than Juno in rank? This festive day calls for both Venus, and
      songs, and wine. These gifts is it fitting to bear to the ruling Gods.

      Bearing these things, and others on which I am silent, I have oft endured
      them; find another in my stead, who could put up with these things. Now my
      ship, crowned with the votive chaplet, listens in safety to the swelling
      waves of the ocean. Cease to lavish your blandishments and the words which
      once availed; I am not a fool, as once I was. Love on this side, Hatred on
      that, are struggling, and are dragging my tender heart in opposite
      directions; but Love, I think, still gets the better. I will hate, <a

      if I can; if not, reluctantly will I love; the bull loves not his yoke;
      still, that which he hates he bears.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fly from treachery; your beauty, as I fly, brings me back; I abhor the
      failings of your morals; your person I love. Thus, I can neither live
      without you, nor yet with you; and I appear to be unacquainted with my own
      wishes. I wish that either you were less handsome, or less unprincipled.
      So beauteous a form does not suit morals so bad. Your actions excite
      hatred; your beauty demands love. Ah wretched me! she is more potent than
      her frailties.
    </p>
    <p>
      O pardon me, by the common rites of our bed, by all the Gods who so often
      allow themselves to be deceived by you, and by your beauty, equal to a
      great Divinity with me, and by your eyes, which have captivated my own;
      whatever you shall be, ever shall you be mine; only do you make choice
      whether you will wish me to wish as well to love you, or whether I am to
      love you by compulsion. I would rather spread my sails and use propitious
      gales; since, though I should refuse, I shall still be forced to love.

      games, and the heifer of the country. 'Twas a great remuneration for my
      stay, to be acquainted with the ceremony; although a path, difficult from
      the ascent, leads the way thither. There stands a grove, ancient, and
      shaded with numberless trees; look at it, you must confess that a Divinity
      exists in the spot. An altar receives the prayers, and the votive incense
      of the pious; an altar made without skill, by ancient hands.

      fled from both his crime and his father's wealth. And now, an exile,
      having wandered over both land and sea, he erected lofty walls with
      prospering hand. He taught his own Falisci the rites of Juno. May they be

      1. From this it is clear, that the first edition which Ovid gave to the
      public of his 'Amores' was in five Books; but that on revising his work,
      he preferred (praetulit) these three books to the former five. It is

      21. The 'pharetra,' or quiver, filled with arrows, was used by most of the
      nations that excelled in archery, among whom were the Scythians, Persians,
      Lycians, Thracians, and Cretans. It was made of leather, and was sometimes
      adorned with gold or painting. It had a lid, and was suspended by a belt
      from the right shoulder. Its usual position was on the left hip, and it
      was thus worn by the Scythians and Egyptians. The Cretans, however, wore
      it behind the back, and Diana, in her statues, is represented as so doing.
      This must have been the method in which Cupid is intended in the present
      instance to wear it, as he has to unloose the quiver before he takes out
      the arrow. Some Commentators, however, would have 'solutâ' to refer simply
      to the act of opening the quiver.]

      or more persons lay on the same couch, the head of one person reached to
      the breast of him who lay above him, and the lower person was said to lie
      on the bosom of the other. Among the Romans, the usual number of persons
      occupying each couch was three. Sometimes, however, four occupied one
      couch; while, among the Greeks, only two reclined upon it. In this
      instance, he describes the lady as occupying the place below her husband,
      and consequently warming his breast with her head. For a considerable time
      after the fashion of reclining at meals had been introduced into Rome, the
      Roman ladies sat at meals while the other sex was recumbent. Indeed, it
      was generally considered more becoming for females to be seated,
      especially if it was a party where many persons were present. Juvenal,
      however, represents a bride as reclining at the marriage supper on the
      bosom of her husband. On the present occasion, it is not very likely that
      the ladies were particular about the more rigid rules of etiquette. It
      must be remembered that before lying down, the shoes or sandals were taken

      to the latest period of the Republic, the rings were mostly of iron, and
      answered the'purpose of a signet. The right of wearing a gold ring
      remained for several centuries the exclusive privilege of Senators,
      Magistrates, and Knights. The emperors were not very scrupulous on whom
      they conferred the privilege of wearing the gold ring, and Severus and
      Aurelian gave the right to all Roman soldiers. Vain persons who had the
      privilege, literally covered their fingers with rings, so much so, that
      Quintilian thinks it necessary to warn the orator not to have them above
      the middle joint of the fingers. The rings and the gems set in them, were
      often of extreme beauty and value. From Juvenal and Martial we learn that
      the coxcombs of the day had rings for both winter and summer wear. They
      were kept in 'dactyliothecæ,' or ring boxes, where they were ranged in a

      In the Fourth Book of the Tristia, Elegy x. 1. GO, he says, 'Corinna, (so
      called by a fictitious name) the subject of song through the whole city,
      had imparted a stimulus to my geuius.' It has been supposed by some
      Commentators, that under this name he meant Julia, either the daughter or
      the grand-daughter of the emperor Augustus, but there seems really to be
      no ground for such a belief; indeed, the daughter of Augustus had passed
      middle age, when Ovid was still in boyhood. It is most probable that
      Corinna was ouly an ideal personage, existing in the imagination of the
      Poet; and that he intended the name to apply to his favourite mistress for
      the time being, as, though he occasionally denies it, still, at other
      times, he admits that his passion was of the roving kind. There are two
      females mentioned in history of the name of Coriuna. One was a Theban
      poetess, who excelled in Lyric composition, and was said to have
      vanquished Pindar himself in a Lyric contest; while the other was a native
      of Thespiæ, in Bceotia. 'The former, who was famous for both her personal
      charms and her mental endowments, is supposed to have suggested the use of
      the name to Ovid.]

      9. 'Tunica' was the name of the under-garment with both sexes among the
      Romans. When the wearer was out of doors, or away from home, it was
      fastened round the waist with a belt or girdle, but when at home and
      wishing to be entirely at ease, it was, as in the present instance, loose
      or ungirded. Both sexes usually wore two tunics. In female dress, Varro
      seems to call the outer tunic 'subucula,' and the 'interior tunica' by the
      name also of 'indusium.' The outer tunic was also called 'stola,' and,
      with the 'palla' completed the female dress. The 'tunica interior,' or
      what is here called tunica,' was a simple shift, and in early times had no
      sleeves. According to Nonius, it fitted loosely on the body, and was not
      girded when the 'stola' or outer tunic was put on. Poor people, who could
      not afford to purchase a 'toga,' wore the tunic alone; whence we find the
      lower classes called by the name of 'tunicati.']

      famous throughout Greece for her extreme beauty, and the high price she
      put upon her favours. Many of the richest and most learned men resorted to
      her, and became smitten by her charms. The second Lais was the daughter of
      Alcibiades, by his mistress, Timandra. When Demosthenes applied for a
      share of her favours, she made the extravagant demand of ten thousand
      drachmae, upon which, regaining his wisdom (which had certainly forsaken

      13. Atalanta, the Arcadian, or Mae-nalian, was the daughter of Iasius, and
      was famous for her skill in the chase. Atalanta, the Boeotian, was the
      daughter of Schceneus, and was renowned for her swiftness, and for the
      race in which she was outstripped by Hippomenes. The Poet has here
      mistaken the one for the other, calling the Arcadian one the daughter of
      Schoeneus. The story of the Arcadian Atalanta is told in the Eighth Book
      of the Metamorphoses, and that of the daughter of Schceneus, at the end of
      the Tenth Book of the same work.]

      8. 'Rhombus,' means a parallelogram with equal sides, but not having right
      angles, and hence, from the resemblance, a spinning wheel, or winder. The
      'licia' were the cords or thrums of the old warp, or the threads of the
      old web to which the threads of the new warp were joined. Here, however,
      the word seems to mean the threads alone. The spinning-wheel was much used
      in magical incantations, not only among the Romans, but among the people
      of Northern and Western Europe. It is not improbable that the practice was
      founded on the so-called threads of destiny, and it was the province of
      the wizard, or sorceress, by his or her charms, to lengthen or shorten
      those threads, according as their customers might desire. Indeed, in some
      parts of Europe, at the present day, charms, in the shape of forms of
      words, are said to exist, which have power over the human life at any
      distance from the spot where they are uttered; a kind of superstition
      which dispenses with the more cumbrous paraphernalia of the
      spinning-wheel. Some Commentators think that the use of the 'licia'
      implied that the minds of individuals were to be influenced at the will of
      the enchanter, in the same way as the old thrums of the warp are caught up
      and held fast by the new threads; this view, however, seems to dispense
      with the province of the wheel in the incantation. See the Second Book of
      the Fasti, 1. 572. The old woman there mentioned as performing the rites
      of the Goddess, Tacita, among her other proceedings, 'binds the enchantea
      threads on the dark-coloured spinning-wheel.']

      its birth is in the habit of biting off, which, if it neglects to do, it

      was a fabulous bird of the owl kind, which was said to suck the blood of

      'the evil eye.' Pliny the Elder says, in his Seventh Book, that 'all women
      injure by their glances, who have a double pupil.' The grammarian,
      Haephestion, tells us, in his Fifth Book, that the wife of Candaulcs, king
      of Lydia, had a double pupil. Heinsius suggests, that this was possibly
      the case with the Ialysian Telchines, mentioned in the Seventh Book of the
      Metamorphoses, 1. 365, 'whose eyes corrupting all things by the very
      looking upon them, Jupiter, utterly hating, thrust them beneath the waves

      been well explained by Burmann, whose ideas on the subject are here
      adopted. The word 'sponsum' has been generally looked upon here as a noun
      substantive, whereas it is the active supine of the verb 'spondeo,' 'to
      become bail' or 'security.' The meaning then is, that some rise early,
      that they may go and become bail for a friend, and thereby incur risk and
      inconvenience, through uttering a single word, 'spondeo,' 'I become
      security,' which was the formula used. The obligation was coutracted
      orally, and for the purpose of evidencing it, witnesses were necessary;
      for this reason the undertaking was given, as in the present instance, in
      the presence of a 'jurisconsultus.']

      39. 'Peculium,' here means the stock of money which a slave, with the
      consent of his master, laid up for his own, 'his savings.' The slaves of
      the Romans being not only employed in domestic offices and the labours of
      the field, but as agents or factors for their masters, in the management
      of business, and as mechanics and artisans in various trades, great
      profits were made through them. As they were often entrusted with a large
      amount of property, and considerable temptations were presented to their
      honesty, it became the practice to allow the slave to consider a part of
      his gains, perhaps a per centage, as his own; this was termed his
      'peculium.' According to the strict letter of the law, the 'peculium' was
      the property of the master, but, by usage, it was looked upon as the
      property of the slave. It was sometimes agreed upon between the master and
      slave, that the latter should purchase his liberty with his 'peculium,'
      when it amounted to a certain sum. If the slave was manumitted by the
      owner in his lifetime, his 'peculium' was considered to be given him, with
      his liberty, unless it was expressly retained.]

      referred to was probably the pantomimic dance, in which, while all parts
      of the body were called into action, the gestures of the arms and hands
      were especially used, whence the expressions 'manus loquacissimi,' 'digiti
      clamosi,' 'expressive hands,' or 'fingers.' During the Republic, and the
      earlier periods of the Empire, women never appeared on the stage, but they
      frequently acted at the parties of the great. As it was deemed disgraceful
      for a free man to dance, the practice at Rome was probably confined to
      slaves, and the lowest class of the citizens. See the Fasti, Book iii. 1.
      536, and the Note to the passage.]

      age, or quality of the wine. Hence the word figuratively means, as in the
      present instance, 'sort,' or 'quality.' Our word 'brand' has a similar
      meaning. The finer kinds of wine were drawn off from the 'dolia,' or large
      vessels, in which they were kept into the 'amphoræ,' which were made of
      earthenware or glass, and the mouth of the vessel was stopped tight by a
      plug of wood or cork, which was made impervious to the atmosphere by being
      rubbed over with pitch, clay, or a composition of gypsum. On the outside,
      the title of the wine was painted, the date of the vintage being denoted
      by the names of the Consuls then in office: and when the vessels were of
      glass, small tickets, called 'pittacia,' were suspended from them, stating
      to a similar effect. For a full account of the ancient wines, see Dr.
      Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities.]

      Aboukir. The epithet 'genialis,' seems to have been well deserved, as it
      was famous for its voluptuousness. Strabo tells us that there was a temple
      there dedicated to Serapis, to which multitudes resorted by the canal from
      Alexandria. He says that the canal was filled, night and day, with men and
      women dancing and playing music on board the vessels, with the greatest
      licentiousness. The place was situate on an island of the Nile, and was
      about fifteen miles distant from Alexandria. Ovid gives a similar
      description of Alexandria, in the Tristia, Book i. El. ii. 1. 79. See the

      13. Macrobius tells us, that the Egyptians accompanied the statue of
      Serapis with that of an animal with three heads, the middle one that of a
      lion, the one to the right, of a dog, and that to the left, of a ravenous
      wolf; and that a serpent was represented encircling it in its folds, with
      its head below the right hand of the statue of the Deity. To this the Poet
      possibly alludes, or else to the asp, which was common in the North of
      Egypt, and perhaps, was looked upon as sacred. If so, it is probable that
      the word 'pigra,' 'sluggish,' refers to the drowsy effect produced by the
      sting of the asp, which was generally mortal. This, indeed, seems the more
      likely, from the fact of the asp being clearly referred to, in company
      with these Deities, in the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 93; which
      see, with the Note to the passage.]

      possession of them was supposed to indicate the possession of considerable

      structure, we must not be surprised at Corinna being in the habit of
      driving for herself. The distance from Rome to Sulmo was about ninety
      miles: and the journey, from his expressions in the fifty-first and

      repeated to me his poem on birds, and each serpent that is deadly, each
      herb that is curative.' The Tenth Epistle of the Second Book of Pontic
      Epistles is also addressed to him, in which Ovid alludes to his work on
      the Trojan war, and the time when they visited Asia Minor and Sicily
      together. He speaks of him in the Sixteenth Epistle of the Fourth Book, as
      being then dead. Macer was a native of Verona, and was the intimate friend
      of Virgil, Ovid, and Tibullus. Some suppose that the poet who wrote on
      natural history, was not the same with him who wrote on the Trojan war;
      and, indeed, it does not seem likely, that he who was an old man in the
      youth of Ovid, should be the same person to whom he writes from Pontus,

      struggled, with unavailing hand, to guide the bridle covered with white
      foam, and throwing myself "backwards, I pulled back the loosened reins.'
      To avoid the danger of this practice, the charioteer carried a hooked
      knife at his waist, for the purpose of cutting the reins on an emergency.]

      38. Instead of the word 'tabella,' 'flabella' has been suggested here; but
      as the first syllable is long, such a reading would occasion a violation
      of the laws of metre, and 'tabella' is probably correct. It has, however,
      the same meaning here as 'flabella it signifying what we should call 'a
      fan;' in fact, the 'flabellum' was a 'tabella,' or thin board, edged with
      peacocks' feathers, or those of other birds, and sometimes with variegated
      pieces of cloth. These were generally waved by female slaves, who were
      called 'flabelliferæ'; or else by eunuchs or young boys. They were used to
      cool the atmosphere, to drive away gnats and flies, and to promote sleep.
      We here see a gentleman offering to fan a lady, as a compliment; and it
      must have been especially grateful amid the dust and heat of the Roman
      Circus. That which was especially intended for the purpose of driving away
      flies, was called 'muscarium.' The use of fans was not confined to
      females; as we learn from Suetonius, that the Emperor Augustus had a slave
      to fan him during his sleep. The fan was also sometimes made of linen,
      extended upon a light frame, and sometimes of the two wings of a bird,
      joined back to back, and attached to a handle.]

      Apollo and Hercules, as well as Pollux, are celebrated by the poets for
      excelling in this exercise. It formed a portion of the Olympic contests;
      while boys fought in the Nemean and Isthmian games. Concerning the
      'cæstus' used by pugilists, see the Fasti, Book ii. 1. 367, and the Note
      to the passage. The method in fighting most practised was to remain on the
      defensive, and thus to wear out the opponent by continual efforts. To
      inflict blows, without receiving any in return on the body, was the great
      point of merit. The right arm was chiefly used for attack, while the
      office of the left was to protect the body. Teeth were often knocked out,
      and the ears were much disfigured. The boxers, by the rules of the game,
      were not allowed to take hold of each other, nor to trip up their
      antagonist. In Italy boxing seems to have been practised from early times
      by the people of Etruria. It continued to be one of the popular games
      during the period of the Republic as well as of the Empire.]

      these seats would be considered the most desirable. It is clear that Ovid
      and the lady have had the good fortune to secure front seats, with the
      feet resting either on the lowest 'præcinctio', or the 'præcinctio' of a
      set of seats higher up. Stools, of course, could not be used, as they
      would be in the way of passers-by. He perceives, as the seat is high, that
      she has some difficulty in touching the ground with her feet, and
      naturally concludes that her legs must ache; on which he tells her, if it
      will give her ease, to rest the tips of her feet on the lattice work
      railing which was opposite, and which, if they were on an upper
      'præcinctio,' ran along the edge of it: or if they were on the very lowest
      tier, skirted the edge of the 'podium' which formed the basis of that
      tier. This she might do, if the 'præcinctio' was not more than a yard

      was held sacred ever afterwards. The same veneration was also paid to a
      place where any person who had been killed by lightning was buried.
      Priests collected the earth that had been torn up by lightning, and
      everything that had been scorched, and buried it in the ground with
      lamentations. The spot was then consecrated by sacrificing a two-year-old
      sheep, which being called 'bidens,' gave its name to the place. An altar
      was also erected there, and it was not allowable thenceforth to tread on
      the spot, or to touch it, or even look at it. When the altar had fallen to
      decay, it might be renovated, but to remove its boundaries was deemed
      sacrilege. Madness was supposed to ensue on committing such an offence;
      and Seneca mentions a belief, that wine which had been struck by
      lightning, would produce death or madness in those who drank it.]

      for the purposes of allotment to the citizens. On apportioning the land, a
      line, which was called 'limes,' was drawn through a given point from East
      to West, which was called 'decumanus,' and another line was drawn from
      North to South. The distance at which the 'limites' were to be drawn

      57. The 'Fora' were of two kinds at Rome; some being market-places, where
      all kinds of goods were exposed for sale, while others were solely courts
      of justice. Among the latter is the one here mentioned, which was simply
      called 'Forum,' so long as it was the only one of its kind existing at
      Rome, and, indeed, after that period, as in the present instance. At a
      later period of the Republic, and under the Empire, when other 'fora,' for
      judicial purposes, were erected, this Forum' was distinguished by the
      epithets 'vetus,' 'old,' or 'magnum, 'great.' It was situate between the
      Capitoline and Palatine hills, and was originally a swamp or marsh, which
      was filled up hy Romulus or Tatius. It was chiefly used for judicial
      proceedings, and is supposed to have been surrounded with the hankers'
      shops or offices, 'argentaria.' Gladiatorial games were occasionally held
      there, and sometimes prisoners of war, and faithless legionary soldiers,
      were there put to death. A second 'Forum,' for judicial purposes, was
      erected hy Julius Caesar, and was called hy his name. It was adorned with
      a splendid temple of Venus Genitrix. A third was built hy Augustus, and
      was called 'Forum Augusts' It was adorned with a temple of Mars, and the
      statues of the most distinguished men of the republic. Having suffered
      severely from fire, this Forum was restored by the Emperor Hadrian. It is
      mentioned in the Fourth Book of the Pontic Epistles, Ep. xv. 1. 16. See

      to accompany his patron on his return to Rome, on which he addressed to
      him the First Elegy of his Third Book, in which he expressed a hope that
      he might not die among the Phæacians. To this Elegy Ovid here refers.
      Tibullus afterwards recovered, and died at Rome. When he penned this line,
      Ovid little thought that his own bones would one day rest in a much more
      ignoble spot than Corcyra, and one much more repulsive to the habits of
      civilization.]

      and praise the property offered for sale. These officers also did the duty
      of the auctioneer, so far as calling out the biddings, but the property
      was knocked down by the 'magister auctionum.' The 'præcones' were also
      employed to keep silence in the public assemblies, to pronounce the votes
      of the centuries, to summon the plaintiff and defendant upon trials, to
      proclaim the victors in the public games, to invite the people to attend
      public funerals, to recite the laws that were enacted, and, when goods
